<p>Many gods have come and gone throughout the history of all the aging races. Only the Elves still revere their original patron deities. Gods have no direct power in the world; a god's influence is through his clerics and priests, and thus the might of a god's following is the might of the god. Most gods seek to shape a particular aspect of the world to their will, for good or for evil. Their followers are bought with boons, gifts, promises, and doctrines pertaining to that aspect which they desire.</p>
<p>Some gods recognize the value of each other's tenets and ally themselves. A group of allied gods is a pantheon. Some gods, who are more altruistic and mundane than imperialistic and grand, are members of multiple pantheons. The enmity or respect between two gods is reflected by that between their followers, and vice versa.</p>
