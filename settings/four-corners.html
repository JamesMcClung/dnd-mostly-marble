<p>The homepage to my "Four Corners" campaign setting. All of my notes are available here. These notes are mostly written from a human-centric point of view.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>At the dawn of the world, the <a href="four-corners/primordials.html">Primordials</a> of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire were anathema to civilization. Each Primordial became known by a different name to each race; humans now call them Behemoth, Typhon, Leviathan, and Shaitan, respectively. They were responsible for all natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions.</p>
<p>Of less tangible presence are the gods. There are hundreds of gods, with no clear hierarchy. Gods go in and out of style with each generation, since the strength of a god is dependent on the number and zeal of its adherents. As such, Humans have adopted thousands of gods over the millenia, and have discarded as many. Longer-lived <a href="four-corners/races.html">races</a> have held on to their gods for much longer, and the immortal Elves revere the same gods as they did in the beginning.</p>
<p>The entire world has been more-or-less fully <a href="four-corners/expansion.html">explored</a> for nearly a century. Shipping networks connect the economies of all major continents: the northeastern Gabroria, Verdania in the far east, the Pyrmies in the southwest, Ata in the west, and the Iceplains of the north.</p>
