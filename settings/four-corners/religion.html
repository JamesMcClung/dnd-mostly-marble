            <div class="p">Most cultures in the world have their own religion. A people might worship one god, many gods, powerful beings, their own ancestors, or something else. Almost every religion has priests invested with genuine power, even if that power isn't necessarily divine in origin.</div>

            <h2 id="gods">Gods</h2>
            <div class="p">Gods have no direct influence over the world. They need worshippers to carry out most tasks on their behalf. In return for doing a god's bidding, a worshipper is given a bit of divine power to do with as they please, as long as it is not counter to their god's designs. Clerics, many paladins, and some druids rely exclusively on this power for spellcasting.</div>
            <div class="p">Since gods derive power from worship, they are in part beholden to their worshippers. A god may choose to reflect changes in his worshippers in order to prevent another god from taking his place, although doing so is taxing for the god. An extreme example of this is the Kuo-Toa goddess, Glishesh. The insane Kuo-Toa constantly revise their ideas of what Glishesh looks like and preaches, and she willingly adapts each time. In her struggle to hold on to her power, Glishesh has become as mad as her followers.</div>
            <div class="p">The above hints at an important point about the gods: they are transient. It is unclear how a god comes into being, but when sufficiently many people worship something new, a new god can appear to fill that niche. Similarly, if people stop worshipping a particular god, that god fades into history.</div>
            <h2 id="spirits-and-other-entities">Spirits and Other Entities</h2>
            <div class="p">Many people worship beings other than true gods. Dragons, demons, spirits, and many more creatures can grant power in exchange for service. This is the source of a warlock's powers. Some druids and paladins also draw their power from a powerful being or force.</div>
            &lt;redacted>
            <h2 id="rogue-gods">Rogue Gods</h2>
            <div class="p">As cultures come and go, gods usually come and go with them. Some gods survive the fall of their progenitors thanks to fragmented cults that worship them. These "rogue gods" are some of the oldest gods. They have to have a strong identity and simple ideals to reduce idealogical drift in their followers. New religions often seek to purge rogue gods and recruit their followers, but some rogue gods are respected even by missionaries.</div>
