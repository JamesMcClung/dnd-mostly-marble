Examples of readying an action include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."</div>
                    <div class="p">When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</div>
                    <div class="p">When you ready the <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#magic">Magic</a> action to cast a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor16" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup8, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup8, anchor16)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup8)">concentration</span> unless it is a cantrip.

                    <div class="p">Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</div>

An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</div>

                    <div class="p">Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</div>
                    <div class="p">There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</div>
                    <h4 id="half-cover">Half Cover</h4>
                    <div class="p">A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</div>
                    <h4 id="three-quarters-cover">Three-Quarters Cover</h4>
                    <div class="p">A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</div>
                    <h4 id="total-cover">Total Cover</h4>
                    <div class="p">A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</div>

You control your space, and can prevent other creatures within 1 size category of yourself from sharing it.

                    <h4 id="squeezing">Squeezing</h4>
                    <div class="p">Squeezing can reduce one or both side lengths of your space down to the value in the Squeezing column of the Creature Sizes table.

                    <div class="p">The value in the Stuck column of the Creature Sizes table is the minimum side length your area of control can have. If at least one side length of your area of control is between the "Stuck" and "Squeezing" values, you are stuck. While stuck, you are <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor40" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup19, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup19, anchor40)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup19)">restrained</span>. You can use your action to make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a success, you can move up to half your speed as if you weren't restrained by being stuck.</div>
                    <h4 id="crushed">Crushed</h4>
                    <div class="p">You cannot willingly reduce a side length of your space to less than the value in the Stuck column of the Creature Sizes table. If you are forced to, you immediately take 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each inch your space's shorter side length subceeds your Stuck value, and you are crushed. You take this damage again at the end of each of your turns as long as you remain crushed. You are also stuck while crushed, and the DC to try to move increases by 1 for each inch your space's shorter side length subceeds your Stuck value.</div>

                        <div class="p">Some spells and other effects require you to maintain concentration in order to keep them active. If you lose concentration, such an effect ends. You can also choose to end concentration on any effect at any time (no action required).</div>

                            <li>You lose concentration if you invoke another effect that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two effects at once.</li>
                            <li>Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.</li>
                            <li>You lose concentration on an effect if you are <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#incapacitated">incapacitated</a> or if you die.</li>
                            <li>Certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, may require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. This is at your DM's discretion.</li>

                        <div class="p">Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</div>
                        <h4 id="dim-light" class="noHeaderID">Dim Light</h4>
                        <div class="p">Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor46" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup5, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup5, anchor46)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup5)">obscured</span> area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</div>
                        <h4 id="darkness" class="noHeaderID">Darkness</h4>
                        <div class="p">Darkness creates a heavily <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor47" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup5, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup5, anchor47)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup5)">obscured</span> area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</div>
