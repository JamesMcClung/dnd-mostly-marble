<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>

<div class="cardgroup">
    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="attack">Attack</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Attack action, you make one weapon attack. See the <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#special-attacks">special attacks</a> section for additional options.</div>

<div class='p'>You can equip or unequip one weapon before or after each attack you make as part of this action, even if the attack is unarmed.</div>

<div class='p'>If you move on your turn, you can use some or all of that movement to move between the attacks of this action if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="offhand-attack">Offhand Attack</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 1 AP </em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Offhand Attack action, you make one weapon attack with a <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor0" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup0, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup0, anchor0)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup0)">light</span> weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the attack, unless that modifier is negative. You must be holding nothing or another light weapon in your other hand, and you can't attack with the same weapon with the Attack and Offhand Attack actions on a turn.</div>

<div class='p'>You can equip or unequip one weapon before or after each attack you make as part of this action, even if the attack is unarmed.</div>

<div class='p'>If you move on your turn, you can use some or all of that movement to move between the attacks of this action if you have a feature, such as Flurry of Blows, that gives you more than one attack as part of this action.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="charge">Charge</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 3 AP </em></div>
        <div class='p'>Taking the Charge action increases your movement for the current turn by your current speed. If you end your movement closer to a creature than where you started, you can make a melee weapon attack against it if it is within reach. If you make this attack, the first attack made against you before the start of your next turn has advantage.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="dash">Dash</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>Taking the Dash action increases your movement for the current turn by your current speed.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="disengage">Disengage</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP </em></div>
        <div class='p'>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="dodge">Dodge</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP </em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="frighten">Frighten</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Frighten action, you may attempt to scare a specific creature within 60 feet of you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, which becomes your Frighten DC. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Frighten DC or be <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor3" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup2, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup2, anchor3)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup2)">frightened</span> of you until the end of your next turn.</div>

<div class='p'>A creature is unaffected by this action if it can neither see nor hear you.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="help">Help</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</div>

<div class='p'>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="hide">Hide</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>The Hide action allows you to attempt to become <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor7" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup5, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup5, anchor7)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup5)">hidden</span> from one or more creatures. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.  If you are heavily obscured or behind at least 3/4 cover relative to a creature, and your check equals or exceeds its passive Perception score, you become hidden from it. The result of the check also becomes your Hide DC, as described in the condition.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: varies (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, or you use a feature or a magic item that requires a Magic action to be activated. This use of the Magic action costs a number of AP determined by the spell or magic item.</div>

<div class='p'>If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain concentration while you do so. This use of the Magic action costs 2 AP. If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot.</div>

<div class='p'>This action is repeatable, but you can only use it to cast one non-cantrip spell per turn.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="ready">Ready</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: varies </em></div>
        <div class='p'>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction.</div>

<div class='p'>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. The Ready action costs the same number of AP as the action you ready, or 2 AP if you ready movement. Examples of readying an action include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the goblin steps next to me, I move away."</div>

<div class='p'>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</div>

<div class='p'>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding onto the spell's magic requires concentration unless it is a cantrip. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the <i>web</i> spell and ready <i>magic missile</i>, your <i>web</i> spell ends, and if you take damage before you release <i>magic missile</i> with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="search">Search</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Search Action, you make a Wisdom Check to discern something that isn't obvious. The Search table suggests which Skills are applicable when you take this Action, depending on what you're trying to detect.</div>

<div class='tableAndCaption'><span class='caption'>Search</span><div class='tableWrapper'><table><thead>

        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Study Action, you make an Intelligence Check to study your memory, a book, a creature, a clue, an object, or another source of knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it.</div>

<div class='p'>The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which Skills are applicable when you take this Action, depending on the area of knowledge the Intelligence Check is about.</div>

        <h1 id="taunt">Taunt</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Taunt action, you may attempt to goad a specific creature within 60 feet of you into attacking you. Make a Charisma (Deception, Performance, or Persuasion) check, which becomes your Taunt DC. The target creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Taunt DC or be <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor14" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup4, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup4, anchor14)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup4)">taunted</span> by you until the end of your next turn.</div>

<div class='p'>A creature is unaffected by this action if it can neither see nor hear you.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="activate-object">Activate Object</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 2 AP (repeatable)</em></div>
        <div class='p'>You normally interact with an object using the <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor15" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup9, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup9, anchor15)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup9)">item interaction</span>. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Activate Object action.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="item-interaction">Item Interaction</h1>
        <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Cost: 0 AP </em></div>
        <div class='p'>When you take the Item Interaction action, you interact with one object or feature of the environment in a trivial way. For example, you could open a door or pick up a dropped weapon. If you need to interact with more than one object on a turn, subsequent interactions require the <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor18" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup10, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup10, anchor18)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup10)">Activate Object</span> action.</div>

        <div class='p'>While blinded, you can't see anything.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="charmed">Charmed</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>While charmed, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>You can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
</li><li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with you.
</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="concentration">Concentration</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>Some spells and other effects require you to maintain concentration in order to keep them active. If you lose concentration, such an effect ends. You can also choose to end concentration on any effect at any time (no action required).</div>

<div class='p'>If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it.</div>

<div class='p'>Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:</div>

<ul><li>You lose concentration if you invoke another effect that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two effects at once.
</li><li>Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.
</li><li>You lose concentration on an effect if you are incapacitated or if you die.
</li><li>Certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, may require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. This is at your DM's discretion.
</li></ul>
    </div>

        <div class='p'>This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds 10. While you have at least 1 level of exhaustion, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>When you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.
</li><li>Subtract your exhaustion level from the spell save DC of any spell you cast.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>Finishing a long rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. You gain 1 level of exhaustion whenever any of the following occur:</div>
<ul><li>You are reduced to 0 hit points and fall unconscious.
</li><li>You fail to sleep for at least 8 hours minus your Constitution modifier in a 24-hour window.

        <h1 id="flanked">Flanked</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>While you are flanked, melee attacks against you gain a +2 bonus to hit.</div>

<div class='p'>You are flanked if there are at least two non-incapacitated enemies on opposite sides of you. Creatures with blindsight, tremorsense, or multiple heads are immune to this condition.</div>

<ul><li>You have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of your fear is within line of sight.

<ul><li>Your speed is halved if you are the same size as the grappled creature, or 0 if you are smaller.
</li><li>When you move on your turn, you drag the grappled creature with you.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>You can end the grapple at any time, no action required. The grapple also ends if you become incapacitated or if the grappled creature is no longer within your reach.</div>

<div class='p'>This condition is commonly acquired via the <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor28" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup13, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup13, anchor28)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup13)">grapple</span> attack.</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved if you are one size larger than the grappling creature, or 0 if you are the same size or smaller.
</li><li>When you move on your turn, you drag the grappling creature with you.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>As a standard action, you can make a saving throw against the grapple, ending the grapple on a success.</div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="heavily-obscured">Heavily Obscured</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>A heavily obscured area, such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, blocks vision entirely. Nothing in that area can be seen.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="light">Light</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</div>

<h4 id="bright-light">Bright Light</h4>
<div class='p'>Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</div>

<h4 id="dim-light">Dim Light</h4>
<div class='p'>Dim light, also called shadows, creates a <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor57" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup22, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup22, anchor57)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup22)">lightly obscured</span> area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</div>

<h4 id="darkness">Darkness</h4>
<div class='p'>Darkness creates a <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor58" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup23, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup23, anchor58)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup23)">heavily obscured</span> area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="lightly-obscured">Lightly Obscured</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="cover">Cover</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</div>

<div class='p'>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</div>

<h4 id="half-cover">Half Cover</h4>
<div class='p'>A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</div>

<h4 id="three-quarters-cover">Three-Quarters Cover</h4>
<div class='p'>A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</div>

<h4 id="total-cover">Total Cover</h4>
<div class='p'>A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="small-card">
        <h1 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</div>

<div class='p'>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</div>

        <h1 id="jump">Jump</h1>
        
        <div class='p'>Jumping lets you clear gaps or obstacles. Distance traveled as part of a jump counts as movement, and like all movement, your total movement on a turn cannot exceed your speed. </div>

<div class='p'>When you jump, perform the following series of calculations. The resulting value is the maximum number of feet you can jump, not counting limitations from your speed.</div>
<ol><li>Start with your passive Athletics. Alternatively, you can make a Strength (Athletics check) and use the result instead.
</li><li>Divide the value by 2.

        <div class='p'>Teleportation is a special kind of magical transportation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear elsewhere instantly, without moving through the intervening space. This transportation doesn't expend movement and doesn't provokes opportunity attacks.</div>

<div class='p'>When you teleport, all the equipment you are wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you are touching another creature when you teleport, that creature doesn't teleport with you, unless the teleportation effect says otherwise.</div>

        <div class='p'>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</div>

<div class='p'>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</div>

        <div class='p'>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</div>

<h4 id="bright-light">Bright Light</h4>
<div class='p'>Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</div>

<h4 id="dim-light">Dim Light</h4>
<div class='p'>Dim light, also called shadows, creates a <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor64" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup22, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup22, anchor64)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup22)">lightly obscured</span> area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</div>

<h4 id="darkness">Darkness</h4>
<div class='p'>Darkness creates a <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor65" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup23, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup23, anchor65)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup23)">heavily obscured</span> area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</div>
