  <p class="feat-prerequisite"><em>Prerequisite: Dragonborn</em></p>
  <p>Your bulk makes flying difficult, but your tough wings make excellent shields. You gain the following benefits: <ul><li>Your wings count as a shield, which you are proficient in.</li><li>Your base AC can be calculated as 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, regardless of your armor.</li><li>If you also have the Shield Master feat, you can use the bonus action to shove each creature in a 15-foot cube instead of just one creature if you do so with your wings.</li></ul></p>

<div class="feat-card">
  <h3 id="soaring-wings">Soaring Wings</h3>
  <p class="feat-prerequisite"><em>Prerequisite: Dragonborn</em></p>
  <p>Your wings are strong enough for flight. You gain a fly speed of 40 feet. If you also have the Shielding Wings feat or are wearing heavy armor, you instead have a fly speed of 20 feet.</p>
