<p>Below are new feats.</p>

<div class="feat-card">
  <h3 id="shielding-wings">Shielding Wings</h3>
  <p class="feat-prerequisite"><em>Prerequisite: Dragonborn</em></p>
  <p>Your bulk makes flying difficult, but your tough wings make excellent shields. You gain the following benefits: <ul><li>Your wings count as a shield, which you are proficient in.</li><li>Your base AC can be calculated as 10 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, regardless of your armor.</li><li>If you also have the Shield Master feat, you can use the bonus action to shove each creature in a 15-foot cube instead of just one creature if you do so with your wings.</li></ul></p>
</div>

<div class="feat-card">
  <h3 id="soaring-wings">Soaring Wings</h3>
  <p class="feat-prerequisite"><em>Prerequisite: Dragonborn</em></p>
  <p>Your wings are strong enough for flight. You gain a fly speed of 40 feet. If you also have the Shielding Wings feat or are wearing heavy armor, you instead have a fly speed of 20 feet.</p>
</div>

<div class="feat-card">
  <h3 id="recovered-soul">Recovered Soul</h3>
  <p class="feat-prerequisite"><em>Prerequisite: Fey Elf</em></p>
  <p>Somehow, you have severed your soul's connection to the Feywild. Before taking this feat, discuss the means by which you accomplish this with your DM, as it may be narratively significant. You gain the following benefits and drawback:<ul><li>You lose your Fey Soul racial trait.</li><li>Your soul is only loosely tied to your body. As a reaction before making an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw against magic, you can cast out your soul to automatically succeed on all such saving throws until the start of your next turn, when your soul returns. While your soul is away, you are under the effects of <i>feign death</i>. You can do this a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once), regaining expended uses after a long rest.</li><li>As a side effect to your soul being loosely bound, it takes 1 less failed death saving throw for you to die.</li></ul></p>
