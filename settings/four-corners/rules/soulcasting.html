<p>Some individuals can impart a piece of their soul into an object. This is done most often, but not exclusively, by spellcasters.</p>

<p>Some objects can be soulcast into more easily than others. See the Base Soulcast DCs table for the base Soulcast DCs of various materials.</p>

<p>Soulcasting is an action and requires you to touch a nonmagical object as you impart a fragment of your soul into it. Choose one or more Impartable Abilities to infuse the item with, and make an ability check. If you are imparting a spell, you must use your spellcasting ability for the check; otherwise, you can choose either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma for it. The DC is equal to the base Soulcast DC of the material the object is made of plus twice the sum of the levels of the imparted abilities. If multiple materials comprise the object, use the highest base Soulcast DC among them.</p>

<p>On a success, the object is soulcast and magical for 24 hours, and you lose whatever abilities you imparted. Whether you succeed or fail, you gain one level of exhaustion after the attempt. </p>

<p>You regain an imparted ability if you are touching the item when the soulcasting ends. You can also regain an imparted ability via training, in which case the training DC is 10x the level of the imparted ability.</p>

<p>You can make a soulcasting permanent by repeating and passing the check a number of times equal to the total level of the soulcasting. Each success resets the duration to 24 hours, and each attempt gives a level of exhaustion as usual. Each of these checks also consumes special reagents that help convince the soul fragment to remain in the object. The DM determines what counts as a valid reagent.</p>
