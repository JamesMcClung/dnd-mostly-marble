        <h1 id="feat-points">Feat Points</h1>

<p>This system replaces the usual method of acquiring feats.</p>

<p>Players gain 2 feat points each level, and may spend feat points at the end of a long rest or upon leveling up.</p>

<p>Half-feats no longer grant ability score increases. These feats are marked by a * below.</p>

<p>A typical feat should cost 8 points, or 4 points for a half-feat.</p>
