<h2 id="grapple">Grapple</h2>

<div class='p'>A grapple consists of two creatures. One creature is grappling, and the other is grappled.</div>

<h3 id="grappling">Grappling</h3>

<div class='p'>While you are grappling, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved if you are the same size as the grappled creature, or 0 if you are smaller.
</li><li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls against a target other than the grappled creature.
</li><li>When you move on your turn, you drag the grappled creature with you.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>You can end the grapple at any time, no action required. The grapple also ends if you become incapacitated or if the grappled creature is no longer in your reach.</div>

<h3 id="grappled">Grappled</h3>

<div class='p'>While you are grappled, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved if you are one size larger than the grappling creature, or 0 if you are the same size or smaller.
</li><li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls against a target other than the grappling creature.
</li><li>When you move on your turn, you drag the grappling creature with you.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>As an action, you can repeat the saving throw against the grapple, ending the grapple on a success.</div>

<h2 id="slowed">Slowed</h2>

<div class='p'>While you are slowed, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved.
</li><li>You can't take reactions.
</li><li>You can't make more than one attack on your turn.
</li><li>You can use either an action or a bonus action on your turn, but not both.
</li><li>If you attempt to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until your next turn, and you must use your action on that turn to complete the spell. If you can't, the spell is wasted.
</li></ul>
