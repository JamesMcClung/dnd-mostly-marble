<h2 id="grappling">Grappling</h2>

<div class='p'>While two creatures are grappling, one of them has the upper hand. The upper hand starts with the one who initiated the grapple.</div>

<div class='p'>One creature can use an attack to attempt to gain the upper hand. Doing so requires a free hand. Both creatures make an Athletics check. If one creature is larger, it has advantage on the check. The winner gets the upper hand.</div>

<h3 id="ending-a-grapple">Ending a Grapple</h3>

<div class='p'>The creature with the upper hand can end the grapple at any time, no action required.</div>

<div class='p'>The other creature can make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns to escape the grapple. It can also use an action to make an Acrobatics check contested by the other creature's Athletics check, escaping if it wins.</div>

<div class='p'>A grapple also ends if the creature with the upper hand can no longer reach the other creature. Forced movement and teleporting can lead to this scenario.</div>

<h3 id="effects-of-grappling">Effects of Grappling</h3>

<div class='p'>If one creature in the grapple moves, the other is dragged along behind.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Size Difference of 2 or More.</i></b> </div>
<ul><li>The smaller creature's speed is 0.
</li><li>The smaller creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against a target that isn't the larger creature.
</li><li>If the larger creature has the upper hand, the smaller creature is Restrained.
</li><li>If the larger creature has the upper hand, it can make a ranged weapon attack using the smaller creature as a thrown projectile. The attack has a range of 20 feet and deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage per size of the smaller creature. If it lands, the smaller creature must also make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take this damage, or half as much on a success. The smaller creature is not considered to be falling unless it leaves the attack's range.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'><b><i>Size Difference of 1.</i></b></div>
<ul><li>The smaller creature's speed is 0.
</li><li>The larger creature's speed is halved, unless it has the upper hand.
</li><li>Each creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against a target that isn't the other creature.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'><b><i>Size Difference of 0.</i></b></div>
<ul><li>The creature with the upper hand's speed is halved, and the other creature's speed is 0.
</li><li>Each creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against a target that isn't the other creature.
</li></ul>
