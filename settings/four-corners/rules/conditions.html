<h2 id="grapple">Grapple</h2>

<div class='p'>A grapple consists of two creatures. One creature is grappling, and the other is grappled.</div>

<h3 id="grappling">Grappling</h3>

<div class='p'>While you are grappling, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved if you are the same size as the grappled creature, or 0 if you are smaller.
</li><li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls against a target other than the grappled creature.
</li><li>When you move on your turn, you drag the grappled creature with you.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>You can end the grapple at any time, no action required. The grapple also ends if you become incapacitated or if the grappled creature is no longer in your reach.</div>

<h3 id="grappled">Grappled</h3>

<div class='p'>While you are grappled, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved if you are one size larger than the grappling creature, or 0 if you are the same size or smaller.
</li><li>You have disadvantage on attack rolls against a target other than the grappling creature.
</li><li>When you move on your turn, you drag the grappling creature with you.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>As an action, you can repeat the saving throw against the grapple, ending the grapple on a success.</div>

<h2 id="transformed">Transformed</h2>

<div class='p'>While transformed into a different type of creature, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, including hit points, Hit Dice, and mental ability scores. You retain your alignment and personality. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
</li><li>You are limited in the actions you can perform by the nature of your new form. You can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless your new form is capable of such actions. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, nor prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast.
</li><li>Your equipment melds into your new form and has no effect.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>The transformation ends if you die, drop to 0 hit points, or are transformed again. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.</div>

<h2 id="slowed">Slowed</h2>

<div class='p'>While you are slowed, you experience the following effects:</div>

<ul><li>Your speed is halved.
</li><li>You can't take reactions.
</li><li>You can't make more than one attack on your turn.
</li><li>You can use either an action or a bonus action on your turn, but not both.
</li><li>If you attempt to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until your next turn, and you must use your action on that turn to complete the spell. If you can't, the spell is wasted.
</li></ul>
