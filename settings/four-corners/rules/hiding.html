<div class='p'>A creature automatically knows your location at all times unless you are either Hidden from or Unknown to that creature.</div>

<h2 id="unknown">Unknown</h2>

<div class='p'>You are Unknown to a creature unless it notices or otherwise suspects your presence. This requires a (minimal) conscious effort on the part of the creature.</div>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="examples-of-being-unknown">Examples of Being Unknown</h4>

<ul><li>You are <i>not</i> Unknown to a dog tracking your scent, a diligent guard on duty, a dragon who is woken by your loud footsteps, or someone who recognizes you in a crowd
</li><li>You <i>may</i> be Unknown to a drunken guard, a sleeping dragon, or a stranger in a busy street
</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hidden">Hidden</h2>

<div class='p'>You are Hidden from a creature if that creature is unable to keep track of where you are. You cease to be Hidden from a creature that sees or hears you. You automatically reveal your location if you attack or cast a spell, unless the spell has neither verbal components nor noticeable effects emanating from you.</div>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="examples-of-being-hidden">Examples of Being Hidden</h4>

<ul><li>You are <i>not</i> Hidden from a guard that hears your armor clanking, or an earth elemental who senses your vibrations
</li><li>You <i>may</i> be Hidden from a guard whose back is turned, a sleeping dog, a passing caravan, or a bandit whose captain just shouted your location
</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<div class='p'><b><i>Hide DC.</i></b> Your Hide DC determines how difficult you are to detect while Hidden. The DC is equal to your passive Stealth by default. A creature whose passive Perception exceeds your Hide DC automatically detects you. If you want to remain Hidden, you must make a Stealth check the first time on a turn you move without sneaking or crawling; the result of the check becomes your Hide DC for up to 1 minute. Sneaking and crawling both take an extra foot of movement for each foot traveled.</div>

<h2 id="hide">Hide</h2>

<div class='p'>The Hide action allows you to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check and attempt to become Hidden from creatures that can't see you. This check becomes your Hide DC for up to 1 hour. Note that this is typically the only way to regain the Hidden status during combat.</div>

<h2 id="search">Search</h2>

<div class='p'>The Search action allows you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to identify the location of Hidden creatures. The DC to detect a Hidden creature is its Hide DC. If the manner of a creature's hiding would cause you to have disadvantage on this check and you don't already have it, its Hide DC is increased by 5 instead for the purpose of this check.</div>
