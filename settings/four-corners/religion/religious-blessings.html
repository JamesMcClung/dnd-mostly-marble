    <h3 id="sonnentum">Sonnentum</h3>
    
    <p>You follow the light of Her Radiance the Sun, worshipped primarily in Sonnenland.</p>
    
<h4 id="blessed-light">Blessed Light</h4>
<p><em>Tier 1 Sonnentum blessing</em></p>
<p>When you cast <i>light</i> or <i>daylight</i>, the light the spell produces is sunlight. Note that this feature does not grant you the ability to cast either of these spells.</p>


<h4 id="inner-radiance">Inner Radiance</h4>
<p><em>Tier 2 Sonnentum blessing</em></p>
<p>You know the <i>light</i> and <i>daylight</i> spells. You can cast <i>daylight</i> once with this feature without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you next witness dawn. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, chosen when you first gain this feature.</p>


<h4 id="cleansing-dawn">Cleansing Dawn</h4>
<p><em>Tier 3 Sonnentum blessing</em></p>
<p>You can cast the spell <i>lesser restoration</i> once with this feature, requiring no components. Both you and the target of the spell must be in bright sunlight when you cast it. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you next witness dawn. Furthermore, when you witness dawn, Her Radiance casts the spell on you if she deems it necessary.</p>


<h4 id="censure-darkfriends">Censure Darkfriends</h4>
<p><em>Tier 4 Sonnentum blessing</em></p>
<p>When you cast a spell that creates sunlight, you can empower the spell. When a creature with natural darkvision starts its turn in bright sunlight created by the empowered spell, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of the source of the light until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 1 hour. Creatures that have darkvision solely due to magic, such as via the <i>darkvision</i> spell, are also immune to this effect. Once you empower a spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you next witness dawn.</p>


<h4 id="purging-dawn">Purging Dawn</h4>
<p><em>Tier 5 Sonnentum blessing</em></p>
<p>You can cast the spell <i>greater restoration</i> once with this feature, requiring no components. Both you and the target of the spell must be in bright sunlight when you cast it. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way after you witness 7 dawns. Furthermore, when you witness dawn, Her Radiance casts the spell on you if she deems it necessary.</p>

<div class="subheaded-card">
    <h3 id="shamalism">Shamalism</h3>
    
    <p>You listen to the lessons of nature, as the Shamal do.</p>
    
<h4 id="power-of-blood">Power of Blood</h4>
<p><em>Tier 1 Shamalism blessing</em></p>
<p>You can use your own blood as a spellcasting focus for any spells you know. To do so, you must use a pointy or sharp object, such as a dagger, to deal 1 point of piercing or slashing damage to yourself; the spell fails and is wasted if you take no damage. You deal this damage as part of the action used to cast the spell, immediately before it takes effect. This damage does not cause you to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.</p>


<h4 id="listen-to-the-beasts">Listen to the Beasts</h4>
<p><em>Tier 2 Shamalism blessing</em></p>
<p>You can cast the spell <i>speak with animals</i> at will.</p>


<h4 id="shamalist-path">Shamalist Path</h4>
<p><em>Tier 3 Shamalism blessing</em></p>
<p>Choose the Path of Sorcery or the Path of Strength. You gain a benefit based on your decision:</p>

<p><i>Path of Sorcery.</i> When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using your own blood as a spellcasting focus while you are bloodied, you can increase the level of the spell by 1. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you recover all your missing hit points.</p>

<p><i>Path of Strength.</i> While you are bloodied, you can use a bonus action to spend a Hit Die and heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you recover all your missing hit points. Additionally, you can use Constitution as the spellcasting ability of any spell you cast using your own blood as a spellcasting focus.</p>


<h4 id="no-drop-wasted">No Drop Wasted</h4>
<p><em>Tier 4 Shamalism blessing</em></p>
<p>If you are bloodied after taking damage from a source other than casting a spell via Power of Blood, you can use a reaction to do one of the following, based on your Shamalist Path:</p>

<p><i>Path of Sorcery.</i> Cast a cantrip or 1st-level spell with a casting time of 1 action. Your own blood from the triggering damage is the spellcasting focus for this spell.</p>

<p><i>Path of Strength.</i> Move up to half your speed and then make a melee or ranged weapon attack with advantage. If you move, you have resistance to all damage during the movement.</p>

<p>Once you use this reaction, you cannot use it again until you recover all your missing hit points.</p>


<h4 id="blood-bond">Blood Bond</h4>
<p><em>Tier 5 Shamalism blessing</em></p>
<p>You can create a blood bond between yourself and another creature. As an action while you are bloodied, you can touch another bloodied creature, which must succeed on a Constution saving throw or suffer a magical effect based on your Shamalist Path:</p>

<p><i>Path of Sorcery.</i> The target's hit point maximum becomes its current hit points indefinitely. This effect is both a disease and a curse. Also on a failed save, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the target's current hit points. These temporary hit points go away if the effect on the target ends.</p>

<p><i>Path of Strength.</i> The target may willingly fail the saving throw. On a failed save, both you and the target are cursed. While cursed in this way and within 60 feet of each other, you and the target share hit points. Add each of your hit point maxima and current hit points to determine your new, shared hit point maximum and current hit points. Whenever one of your hit points would change, the hit points of the other changes too, so they are always the same. The curse ends immediately after your shared current hit points is reduced to 0 or lower, or if you and the target are ever on a different plane of existence. If the curse ends on one of you, it ends on both of you. When it ends, your hit point maxima return to normal, and you each get half of your shared current hit points.</p>

<p>Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead are immune to this feature. Once you use this action, you cannot use it again until you are reduced to 0 hit points, fail a death saving throw, and then recover all your missing hit points.</p>
