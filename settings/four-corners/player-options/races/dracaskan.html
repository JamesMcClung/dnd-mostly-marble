They share the islands with many creatures that live nowhere else. Their most notable cohabitants, however, are dragons. Many dragons make their nests and lairs in Žagraš. Those that do are often worshipped by local dracaska.</div> <h2 id="dragon-worship">Dragon Worship</h2> <div class="p">Dragon worship is a significant part of dracaskan life. Each tribe favors a particular dragon, bringing gifts of food, treasure, and praise. A select few members of the tribe are entrusted with guarding the dragon's nest or hoard, especially in the dragon's absence. In exchange, a dragon protects its servants from other tribes and other dragons.</div> <div class="p">The ideals of each tribe are shaped by the ideals of their patron dragon. Thus, some tribes are brutal and cutthroat, some are reserved and reclusive, and others are gentle or philanthropic. Similarly, diplomacy between any two tribes parallels that of their respective dragons. Most dragons are territorial, so dracaskan tribes are generally wary of their neighbors and often at war. Some dragons, especially younger ones, lack territory; these "rogue" dragons and their nomadic followers follow different diplomatic rules than established dragons and their tribes.</div> <div class="p">Despite the zeal a tribe displays in aggregate towards its dragon, it is common for individuals to move between tribes. Dragons and tribe leaders may expel, adopt, or even trade members, especially young members who can use their wings to fly.</div> <h3 id="those-of-frozen-hearts">Those of Frozen Hearts</h3> <div class="p">Far south of <i>Žagraš</i>, where the sea is frozen all year, is the domain of a single dragon: <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor">Čalšaus</span><span class="tooltip">Coldest</span></span>, the Ice Dragon. The only dragon alive to be shunned by all others of his kind, the entire southern ocean is his hunting ground. His breath turned to frost long ago. He is infamous among human whalers for destroying ships and stealing whale carcasses, although sightings of him are often separated by decades.</div> <div class="p">Čalšaus is not without followers, however. The ice plains are home to a scattering of unusual dracaska. They are <i>Sustanusu Šržu</i>, or Those of Frozen Hearts—dracaska who, by birth, chance, choice, or exile, wound up in the freezing south at the mercy of the cold. Like Čalšaus, their bodies are adapted to the frigid climate, although the lesser dracaska still fare poorly. They all pay tribute to Čalšaus.</div> &lt;redacted> <h2 id="physiology">Physiology</h2> <div class="p">The dracaskan species can be subdivided into two species: lesser and greater. Like their <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/races/soraskan.html">soraskan</a> cousins, dracaska hatch from eggs and require little care from their parents. Also like soraska, female dracaska are larger than male dracaska and play the dominant role in dracaskan politics. Dracaska have a much faster metabolism than soraska, fueled in part by the ambient heat of the archipelago's bedrock.</div> <div class="p">The most obvious difference between soraska and dracaska is that the latter have wings. These wings are only strong enough to sustain flight during a dracaskan's early adulthood, but even then, the wings require extensive training to use. Dracaskan bones and scales toughen with age, eventually making flight impossible. Additionally, some dracaska are born without wings at all. These unfortunate individuals, called <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>štarnu</i></span><span class="tooltip">lack-wings</span></span>, are at the absolute bottom of the social hierarchy.</div> &lt;redacted> <h2 id="lesser-dracaska">Lesser Dracaska</h2> <div class="p">Lesser dracaska, or <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>kulžas</i></span><span class="tooltip">small folk</span></span> in <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/languages.html#draconic">Draconic</a>, generally occupy lower ranks in the surface tribes. Not all lesser dracaska worship a dragon, however. Many dwell in large colonies in lava tubes, where the enhanced warmth invigorates them. These tunnel-dwelling <i>kulžas</i>, or <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>urnakulžas</i></span><span class="tooltip">cave-dwelling small folk</span></span>, are occasionally seen carrying strange contraptions and magical devices. They even have their own language, <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/languages.html#urnakasla"><i>Urnakasla</i></a></span><span class="tooltip">cave speech</span></span>. No outsider has seen the full extent of an <i>urnakulžas</i> tunnel colony, but it is suspected that some colonies may be more advanced than they appear.</div> <div class="p">Lesser dracaska have been known to meditate on hot rocks near open lava, and when noticed—or for no apparent reason at all—burst with energy and scurry away.</div> <h2 id="greater-dracaska">Greater Dracaska</h2> <div class="p">A greater dracaskan, or <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>graužas</i></span><span class="tooltip">tall folk</span></span> in Draconic, can easily reach a height of 6 feet by age 15, and they continue to grow throughout their entire life. This unchecked growth eventually leads to heart failure in old age, when heights over 8 feet and weights exceeding 400 pounds are typical. One <i>graužas</i> legend tells of <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>Rkalgasuka</i></span><span class="tooltip">Head in the Sky</span></span>, a priestess who used magic to sustain her heart—and grew to a size rivaling the dragon she served. Feeling threataned, the dragon expelled her, but she was so old and wise that most of the tribe left to follow her. She eventually grew so big she became a god, and her body became the second-largest island of <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>Rkalgasukatu</i></span><span class="tooltip">Bones of Head in the Sky</span></span>.</div> <div class="medium-card"> <h1 id="dracaskan">Dracaskan</h1> <div class="card-stats"> <div class="card-stats-row"> <div class="p"><b>Size</b><br>Varies</div> <div class="p"><b>Speeds</b><br><span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="speeds#walk" onclick='handleAnchorClick("speeds#walk", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("speeds#walk", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("speeds#walk", event)'>Walk</span> 30 ft.</div> <div class="p"><b>Old Age Threshold</b><br>Varies</div> </div> <div class="card-stats-row"> <div class="p"><b>Languages</b><br><a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/languages.html#draconic">Draconic</a></div> <div class="p"><b>Senses</b><br><span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="senses#darkvision" onclick='handleAnchorClick("senses#darkvision", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("senses#darkvision", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("senses#darkvision", event)'>Darkvision</span> 60 ft.</div> <div class="p"><b>Aging Rate</b><br>1 year</div> </div> </div> <h2 id="traits">Traits</h2> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Fire Conversion.</i></b> You have resistance to fire damage, and you partially absorb its power and accumulate the energy within yourself.
