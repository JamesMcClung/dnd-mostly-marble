Their salamander-like skin can come in different pastel hues, with pink, blue, and yellow being the most common colors.</div> <div class="p">Ixilit live deep under the ocean and rarely interact with surface dwellers.

Ixilit have the lowest Strength and Dexterity scores of any race. A typical ixilit isn't even strong enough to lift their own body weight.</div> <div class="p"><b>Open Minds.</b> Most of an ixilit's strength comes from its mind—literally. They rely on telekinetics for moving about and telepathy for communication. Their superb spatial reasoning in particular contributes to their above-average Intelligence and Wisdom scores.</div> <h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3> <div class="p">Ixilit society is cooperative.
