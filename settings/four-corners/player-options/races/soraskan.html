Cave soraska live in the northern mountains of Ata. Lean, nimble, and averaging around 5'8" in height, they are adept hunters and known to hunt cave halflings. Cave soraska are deeply religious and have theocratic local governments. &lt;redacted></div> <div class="p">Sea soraska live in southern Verdania. They are much bulkier than their Atan cousins, with an average height of around 6'3". As a unified statocracy, their navy is the single largest in the world, although <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/races/human.html">humans</a> have more ships overall.

Soraska begin life at the lowest rank and can gain rank as a reward for excellence.

The death penalty is never utilized; at worst, a soraskan is demoted to the lowest rank and tattooed with markings that prevent them from regaining rank.</div> <div class="p">Soraska don't follow the same "good" and "bad" morality as other races.

The standard singular form of the noun is "soraskan", which is the same as the adjective form. The plural form "soraskans" is technically incorrect but still commonly used, especially by non-Elvish speakers. Before communication with elves, no human language besides <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/languages.html#ogofen">Ogofen</a> had a word for soraska, since cave soraska were unknown to any but the other denizens of the mountain caves.</div> <div class="medium-card"> <h1 id="soraskan">Soraskan</h1> <div class="card-stats"> <div class="card-stats-row"> <div class="p"><b>Size</b><br>Medium</div> <div class="p"><b>Speeds</b><br><span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="speeds#walk" onclick='handleAnchorClick("speeds#walk", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("speeds#walk", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("speeds#walk", event)'>Walk</span> 30 ft.</div> <div class="p"><b>Old Age Threshold</b><br>50 years</div> </div> <div class="card-stats-row"> <div class="p"><b>Languages</b><br>Varies</div> <div class="p"><b>Senses</b><br><span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="senses#supersmell" onclick='handleAnchorClick("senses#supersmell", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("senses#supersmell", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("senses#supersmell", event)'>Supersmell</span> 10 ft.</div> <div class="p"><b>Aging Rate</b><br>20 years</div> </div> </div> <h2 id="traits">Traits</h2> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Poison Conversion.</i></b> You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/conditions.html#poisoned">poisoned</a>.
