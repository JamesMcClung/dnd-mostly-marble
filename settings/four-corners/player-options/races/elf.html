They resemble lean humans with long limbs and fingers, angular faces, slanted eyes, and tapered ears that they can move.</div> <div class="p">Elves have been shaped by magic more than any other race. The four elf subraces—blessed, sea, deep, and fey—derive their distinguishing features from extreme magical events or environments.</div> <h2 id="blessed-elves">Blessed Elves</h2> <div class="p">Over ten thousand years ago, the elves of the land received the gift of immortality from a god. This event is known as <i>Mirakunum</i>, or "The Blessing". Since then, those elves have been immune to the weathering of old age, although they can still be killed by injury or illness. The only exceptions are those elves who were already old when the Blessing occurred, of whom few survive.</div> <div class="p">Due to their longevity, the history of the blessed elves is well-preserved. It is rife with conflict with <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/races/soraskan.html">soraskans</a> over control of the east and west coasts. Unlike other races, the blessed elves rarely attempted to build large cities, roads, farmlands, or other structures, opting instead to live in scattered, self-sufficient dwellings. Thus, most elf scholars worked in solitude, and scientific progress was all but nonexistent.</div> <div class="p">When elves did collaborate, their works were unmatched. Sadly, the larger works invariably drew the attention of the <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/primordials.html">primordials</a>, and each one was destroyed along with countless smaller works and the elves who made and protected them. In this way, their indefinite lifespan was a curse to their race: while children eventually replaced the fallen elves in number, they could never replace the fallen elves' ambition, for the ambitious elves were disproportionately likely to be slain. Worse, each catastrophe reinforced the modesty and reticence of the survivors. The divide between these two ways of thinking has only widened with time. Each group has a name: the audacious <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>nauvir</i></span><span class="tooltip">high elves</span></span>, and the conservative <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>omavir</i></span><span class="tooltip">wood elves</span></span>.</div> <div class="p">The blessed elves' greatest accomplishment—and loss—was the coastal city of <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>Luminarys</i></span><span class="tooltip">City of Lights</span></span>. Founded in <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/timeline.html#-1642">-1642 SK</a> and designed to withstand attacks from primordial and soraskan alike, it stood strong for over 700 years. Its fall in <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/timeline.html#-857">-857 SK</a> was precipitated by the only known instance of Leviathan and Shaitan attacking the same target simultaneously, which its makers had presumed to be impossible. Relics from Luminarys and other ruined cities are occasionally discovered to this day, most often by sea elves.</div> <div class="p">Among all the crafts practiced by blessed elves, metalwork is the rarest. It is far easier for an individual elf to work with wood than it is to mine and refine the numerous materials needed for forging metal. The greater limiting factor is the extreme scarcity of metals in Verdania. The few elves that do go through the trouble are sure to produce masterwork pieces, however. Nearly every elven weapon, armor, trinket, and tool made of metal is intricately wrought and magically enchanted. More common crafts include lapidary, as gems are abundant in Verdania and useful for magical endeavors; arboriculture, as blessed elves are uniquely capable of witnessing the long process of tree growth; and weaving, as the materials for it are plentiful and countless hours can be spent on it. Most elves practice multiple artisanal skills, as well as art, study, and athletics.</div> <h2 id="sea-elves">Sea Elves</h2> <div class="p">According to legend, sea elves' ancestors were from a great elven kingdom—on land. The story goes that Shaitan attempted to destroy their kingdom by expelling so much lava from Verdoa that the land sunk into the sea. Their ruler King Mo'ire cast a powerful spell in an attempt to save his kingdom. When the city continued slipping into the sea, he thought his spell had failed, and his people were doomed. The elves, however, found themselves suddenly able to breathe water, and managed to escape Shaitan's wrath by fleeing into the ocean just as lava began to seal the city in its watery grave. The survivors, or <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>marevir</i></span><span class="tooltip">sea elves</span></span> as they call themselves, have lived in the sea ever since. Most sea elves live in the Verdanian Gulf, but their offshore settlements can be found worldwide.</div> <div class="p">If the story is true, it occurred long before the Blessing, as it was a legend even in the childhood of the oldest blessed elves. Best guesses put it at around <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/timeline.html#-14500">-14500 SK</a>. Many doubt its authenticity for four main reasons. First, the manner of the city's destruction is considered dubious. Volcanic activity is common on Verdania, but it has only been observed to create land, not sink it. Second, the amount of power required by such a spell would have been far too much to be wielded by the apocryphal king. Third, even if someone could have cast such a powerful spell, the magic affecting the sea elves should still be present, but their form is not magical. Fourth, the city has never been found, despite extensive searching. For these reasons, few other than the sea elves themselves take the story seriously. Most attribute the existence of sea elves to divine intervention, and cite the Blessing as proof of plausibility.</div> <div class="p">Whatever their origin, sea elves are well-adapted to marine life. They have gray-blue skin and long, webbed digits. Of their face, they have large eyes sharp teeth, and flattened noses. Most strikingly, sea elves lack hair and external ears, possessing motile head-fins instead. Also to many foreigners' surprise, sea elves prefer to go without clothing, since it significantly slows them down. Sea elves do wear clothing when necessary, such as for pockets, armor, status, or ceremony. The simplest clothes are fashioned of kelp, while extravagant attire incorporates large shells strung together. Armor is also made of shells or scales. Coral, pearls, and small shells are common adornments. Leather and hide are rare, as they can't readily be tanned underwater.</div> <div class="p">Culturally, sea elves are superficially friendly and inviting, but their smiles can quickly turn to sneers if their visitor proves incompetent. (Note: sea elves consider the inability to breathe underwater to be a sign of incompetence, and will not help a drowning <i>hanea</i>—"air breather", an insult.) Sea elves are also sensitive about their military history. They feel that the land-dwelling races don't appreciate their efforts to keep sea monsters at bay, and are contemptuous of those who are ignorant of the threats of the deep sea.</div> <div class="p">Sea elf civilization is fragmented by the oceans. The open ocean is too dangerous in its depths, and too barren near the surface, for sea elves to cross it often. Atan and Gabrorian sea elves are mostly nomadic, traveling along the continental shelves with the seasons. These sea elves rarely develop lasting relations with coastal land-dwellers. Most land-dwellers—especially sailors—treat sea elves with great caution due to the sea elves' reputation for luring inexperienced sailors to crash their ships on rocks. Such incidents are usually accidental: the elves sometimes sing on rocks above the water, and the sailors get too close in their attempt to see the source of the sound. Survivors allege that the elves deliberately entranced them with their voice.</div> <div class="p">Verdania lacks a continental shelf, so most sea elves there live in permanent settlements in the shallow Verdanian Gulf. They maintain formal, but sometimes tense, relations with the blessed elves on land. An important part of their relationship pertains to trade, especially in metals. Sea elves have access to ore deposits, but lack the means to work them; the blessed elves have forges, but little ore. Sea elves from all continents barter with land-dwellers, but it is most extensive in Verdania.</div> <h2 id="deep-elves">Deep Elves</h2> <div class="p">Deep elves are the unwelcome cousins of sea elves, adapted to life in the darkest depths of the ocean. They were once sea elves, but their worship of the kraken Lolugo led to their exile in <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/timeline.html#-2500">-2500 SK</a> and name of <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>malevir</i></span><span class="tooltip">bad elves</span></span>.</div> <div class="p">Lolugo was actually slain in <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/timeline.html#-1174">-1174 SK</a> after a long war between deep elves and sea elves. The deep elves have since devoted themselves to the resurrection of their god. They believe that ritual sacrifices and aberrant magic are the key to doing so. Their religion, called <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/religion.html">Aquorism</a>, holds aberrations as angels and malice as virtue. Their priests are the most warped specimens of their kind, both physically and mentally. To perform their ceremonies, deep elves regularly creep into shallow waters to kidnap sea elves, sailors, and sometimes coastal villagers. A captain who fails to take enough captives must sacrifice family members as punishment.</div> <div class="p">Deep elves are extremely diverse in outward appearance due to the range and severity of mutations that afflict them; crab claws, tentacles, half-formed fish tails, and bine spines are some examples. Some are debilitating outside of water, and all are unseemly, but they can also be a source of power and pride. Their minds fragmented as they are, an individual deep elf may both loathe and cherish its physique. The changes did not come about until after their banishing, and deep elves see them as a curse from their enemies and a reminder of their banishment. And yet, the changes were a gift from their gods, and are thus a blessing.</div> &lt;redacted> <h2 id="fey-elves">Fey Elves</h2> <div class="p">Sime time around <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/timeline.html#-15000">15,000 years ago</a>, a being approached a group of young elves. Introducing herself as <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor">Uhane</span><span class="tooltip">soul</span></span>, she led the elves through a copse of trees and spoke of a world that was shaped as much by the mind as by the flesh. Presently, the elves found themselves in this fey place, and explored its wonders with delight. Hours passed, and Uhane warned them that staying any longer would risk the lives of their loved ones. The elves paid no heed and continued their revelry—for how could the lives of others be endangered by their actions here, so far away? Days later, they finally emerged to find that 100 years had passed in their absence. All those they had known were dead or gone. The elves went back to the copse of trees and begged Uhane to let them back in, and she assented, but with a condition: they must give up their home realm for good, and tie their souls to the other place. In exchange, they would be granted long lives and stations of privilege under the fey realm's true ruler. Every one of them agreed, and when they stepped foot into Uhane's plane, they became the first <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor"><i>perevir</i></span><span class="tooltip">wandering elves</span></span>.</div> <div class="p">The other place was the <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/planes/feywild.html">Feywild</a>, now known to be a distinct plane of existence. The fey elves were likely its first inhabitants. They still rule the plane, although their relative strength has weakened as the plane itself has expanded. Most of them are not nobility. Fey elves could pass as normal elves but for their unnaturally vibrant skin and hair, which come in all hues. Their eyes are solid globes of color, lending them an inscrutable air. Like the Feywild itself, their moods are fickle and extreme. They can come across as juvenile in both their mirth and their wrath.</div> <div class="p">Fey elves do not leave the Feywild lightly. Their soul is tied to that plane. For reasons not fully understood, they are incapable of most magic outside the Feywild, and the magic they do manage is unrecognized and unaffected by spells such as <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/spells.html#detect-magic"><i>detect magic</i></a> and <a href="/settings/four-corners/player-options/spells.html#dispel-magic"><i>dispel magic</i></a>.</div> &lt;redacted> <h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2> <div class="medium-card"> <h1 id="elf">Elf</h1> <div class="card-stats"> <div class="card-stats-row"> <div class="p"><b>Size</b><br>Medium</div> <div class="p"><b>Speeds</b><br><span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="speeds#walk" onclick='handleAnchorClick("speeds#walk", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("speeds#walk", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("speeds#walk", event)'>Walk</span> 35 ft.</div> <div class="p"><b>Old Age Threshold</b><br>70 years</div> </div> <div class="card-stats-row"> <div class="p"><b>Languages</b><br>Varies</div> <div class="p"><b>Senses</b><br><span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="senses#darkvision" onclick='handleAnchorClick("senses#darkvision", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("senses#darkvision", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("senses#darkvision", event)'>Darkvision</span> 60 ft.</div> <div class="p"><b>Aging Rate</b><br>5 years</div> </div> </div> <h2 id="traits">Traits</h2> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Enhanced Darkvision.</i></b> Your innate <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/senses.html#darkvision">darkvision</a> allows you to see in starlight as if it were bright light regardless of the actual <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="environment#light" onclick='handleAnchorClick("environment#light", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("environment#light", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("environment#light", event)'>light</span> level, but distances beyond 60 feet are lightly <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/environment.html#obscured">obscured</a> as if by mist.
