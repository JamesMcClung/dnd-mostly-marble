An empathetic goblin is a genetic failure; they are rare, and unlikely to survive in the backstabbing world of goblin society.</div> <h2 id="underground-colonies">Underground Colonies</h2> <img src="/images/4c/goblin.png" alt="goblin.png"> <div class="p">Common goblin civilization comprises thousands of small tribes scattered just underground and massive colonies in the larger caverns below. Only two things unite them: hatred for surface dwellers and fear of the more powerful denizens of the caves.</div> <div class="p">The extent of goblin infrastructure is short connecting tunnels between natural caverns. Few tunnels actually connect to where they were intended. More often, they dead-end due to lost motivation, going in the wrong direction, or—if so much as a single gemstone is unearthed—the entire mining team self-destructs in a frenzy of murders. Fortunately, goblins always find a use for empty tunnels.</div> <div class="p">Thousands of goblins in a small space would make for an unholy amount of filth if not for the wormpits. <i>Gorv</i> (likely a shortened form of the words for "shit worm") worms flourish in designated waste pits and can reach gargantuan sizes if left unchecked. Many fungi also grow in the wormpits. The most important variety, <i>ukugogli</i> (suspiciously reminiscent of the words for "tasty shit mushroom"), is a staple in goblin cuisine. The other staple is fried gorv.</div> <div class="clear-float"></div> <h2 id="shadowed-citadels">Shadowed Citadels</h2> <img src="/images/4c/dark-goblin.png" alt="dark-goblin.png"> <div class="p">Dark goblins are fewer in number but more organized. They live in some of the deepest tunnels of Gabroria. They show some measure of skill in masonry and carve out proper cities, even if the angles aren't quite aligned. They worship Amnat, a god of darkness and vengeance, in a religion called <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/religion.html">Mrakism</a>. Common goblins fear them.</div> <div class="clear-float"></div> <h2 id="predatory-abominations">Predatory Abominations</h2> <div class="p">Rarest of all, ungoblins are solitary hunters, and have no culture of their own. Most ungoblins do not even speak a language. They stalk shallow caves in western Gabroria. Ungoblins are feared by all races for their hunting tactic: they lie in wait in a cave just below the surface with an entrance nearby. When a creature gets close enough, the ungoblin unleashes a psychic attack to either kill or stun the victim. Once its prey is neutralized, the ungoblin emerges from its hiding place and finishes the job.</div> &lt;redacted> <h2 id="physical-appearances">Physical Appearances</h2> <div class="p">Common goblins are short, bony, greasy things with sickly green skin of any shade. Malnutrition often gives them distended bellies and other deformities.</div> <div class="p">Dark goblins are similar in build but with white, slightly translucent skin and huge eyes. They stay partially cloaked in tendrils of shadow whenever possible.</div> <div class="p">Ungoblins are twisted even by goblin reckoning. They have empty sockets for eyes, soft and bendable bones, and fingers that are twice as long as they ought to be. Extra fingers, limbs, and even heads afflict one ungoblin in three.</div> <h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2> <h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3> <div class="p"><b>Disease-Ridden.</b> Goblin dens and cities are known for being filthy. Goblins suffer for it, having a low average Strength and Constitution score.</div> <div class="p"><b>Survival by Cunning.</b> Goblin society can be cutthroat. The slow and stupid are taken advantage of and don't last long. The survivors tend to be those with high Dexterity or Intelligence.</div> <h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3> <div class="p">Most goblin societies encourage shenanigans, bastardry, and deviousness. Good goblins don't last long in the underdark without likeminded friends.</div> <h3 id="age">Age</h3> <div class="p">Goblins are short-lived creatures, reaching maturity at age 7.
