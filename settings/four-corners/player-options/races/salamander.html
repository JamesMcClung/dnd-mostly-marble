Four more were found since then across a total of three volcanos, with the last town being found in 154 SK.</div> <div class="p">The cinder dwarves now employ Salamanders in exchange for information and material goods. With the dwarves' guidance, Salamanders have constructed proper citadels in their original pits. Some now travel the world.</div> <h2 id="young-race-young-people">Young Race, Young People</h2> <div class="p">Without anything resembling traditions or a history, Salamander culture is virtually nonexistant. Most Salamanders live their lives in a state of perpetual shock at being alive at all. This bewilderment wears off very slowly over time; only the oldest Salamanders have much personality at all.</div> <h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2> <div class="p">Salamanders resemble a cross between a newt and a turtle, if that cross were made of lava. Dark volcanic rock covers a Salamander's back, including down to the tip of their tail and to the top of their head. Islands of rock jut out from other parts of the body, especially near joints. The limbs, head, and tail are otherwise smooth, glowing lava.</div> <div class="clear-float"></div> <h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2> <h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3> <div class="p"><b>Gradual Awakening.</b> Salamanders start their lives all but mindless. Their personalities develop slowly; many salamanders have a low Charisma score for decades.</div> <div class="p"><b>Elemental Endurance.</b> The supernatural physiology of salamanders is associated with a very high average Constitution score, and to a lesser extend, a high average Strength score.</div> <div class="p"><b>Perpetually Cold.</b> Some salamanders burn hot enough to maintain fine motor skills, but most do not and thus have a low Dexterity score.</div> <h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3> <div class="p">Young Salamanders are neutral as can be. As their personality develops, their alignment may crystallize to anything, but usually ends up more lawful and good than chaotic or evil.</div> <h3 id="age">Age</h3> <div class="p">If Salamanders do age, none have lived long enough to find out. They are generally considered mature at age 50 when their personality is mostly figured out, but there are no physical changes whatsoever. &lt;redacted></div> <h3 id="speed">Speed</h3> <div class="p">Your base walking speed depends on the ambient temperature.
