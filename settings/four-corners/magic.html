Magic of the First Kind is "natural" magic, such as what powers storms, the heavens, and elementals. Magic of the Second Kind includes spellcasting, and is the magic affected by spells such as <i>dispel magic</i> and <i>antimagic field</i>. Magic of the Third Kind includes everything else, most notably psionics. There are some disputes on certain points, such as whether dragons use the First Kind or the Third Kind to power their flight and breath weapons.</div> &lt;redacted> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
