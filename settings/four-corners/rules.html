        <h1 id="rules-for-this-setting">Rules for This Setting</h1>

<div class='p'>All of these rules are open to discussion and, if all players agree, change.</div>

<h2 id="making-your-character">Making Your Character</h2>

<div class='p'><b><i>Feat Points.</i></b> You start with 2 <a href="#feat-points">feat points</a> at level 1.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Race.</i></b> Game mechanics for some races are provided on the <a href="races.html#game-mechanics">races</a> page and elsewhere. Use those mechanics instead of mechanics from other sources. Some races do not exist in the setting at all. Check with the DM if you want to play a race that is not mentioned on the races page.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Racial Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Since races no longer grant ability score increases, you may increase one score by 2 and another score by 1, or three different scores by 1 each.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Background.</i></b> Backgrounds are more impactful in this setting. Pick a background from the <a href="backgrounds.html">backgrounds</a> page instead of any other source.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Background Proficiencies.</i></b> Since backgrounds don't necessarily grant skill proficiencies, you may pick any two skills and any one tool. You are proficient in those skills and that tool.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Common Language.</i></b> On top of languages acquired through other means, you know the one language agreed on by the party and DM to be the common language of the party.</div>

<h2 id="removed-content">Removed Content</h2>

<div class='p'>Content from Unearthed Arcana is <i>not</i> allowed, especially feats.</div>

<div class='p'>The following spells are unavailable:</div>
<ul><li><i>Leomund's tiny hut</i>
</li><li>that's it
</li></ul>

<h2 id="new-rules">New Rules</h2>

<h3 id="feat-points">Feat Points</h3>

<div class='p'>See <a href="../../rules/feat-points.html">feat points</a> for an explanation of the feats system, and <a href="feats.html">feats</a> for the actual feats available.</div>

<h3 id="soulcasting">Soulcasting</h3>

<div class='p'>See <a href="rules/soulcasting.html">soulcasting</a>.</div>

<h3 id="bloodied">Bloodied</h3>

<div class='p'>A creature is called "bloodied" if its current hit points is equal to or less than half its hit point maximum. This is the point at which the creature's body shows obvious signs of harm. In general, it is possible to tell at a glance whether a creature is bloodied.</div>

<h3 id="dropping-to-0-hit-points">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>
<div class='p'>When you are reduced to 0 hit points and fall unconscious, you gain a level of exhaustion.</div>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="variant-rules-injuries">Variant Rules: Injuries</h4>
<div class='p'>Consider the <a href="rules/simple-injuries.html">simple injuries</a> and <a href="rules/hardcore-injuries.html">hardcore injuries</a> variants. These variants are mutually exclusive and replace the above rule about gaining a level of exhaustion.</div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="resurrection">Resurrection</h3>
<div class='p'>Resurrection brings a soul back to the material plane. This also provides a means for supernatural creatures to slip in with the revived soul. The DM rolls on the Unwanted Follower table when one of the following spells is cast: <i>revivify, raise dead, resurrection</i>, or <i>true resurrection.</i></div>

<table><caption>Unwanted Follower</caption><thead>
<tr><th align='center'>d10</th><th align='left'>Result</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr><td align='center'>1</td><td align='left'>The spell requires an additional 1 minute to cast, and creatures of total CR at least the level of the spell appear next to the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>2-5</td><td align='left'>Creature of total CR at least the level of the spell appear next to the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>6-9</td><td align='left'>Creature of total CR at most the level of the spell appear next to the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>10</td><td align='left'>Nothing unusual happens.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<div class='p'>Both dying and coming back to life involve planar travel of the soul. A soul normally departs the plane on which it died after 1 minute. If the soul does not depart after 24 hours, it may manifest as a ghost.</div>

<h3 id="old-age">Old Age</h3>
<div class='p'>An "old" creature receive a -1 penalty to all ability scores. If that creature is a player character, its maximum ability score value is also reduced by 1 (from 20 to 19). See the "age" section of a racial statblock or ask the DM for what qualifies as old.</div>

<h3 id="arduous-travel">Arduous Travel</h3>
<div class='p'>You may have to make a Constitution check in order to gain the benefits of a long rest. The DC is 5, modified by the environment and your level of preparation as shown in the Travel Hazards table. You do not have to make the check if the DC is less than 10. However, if you make the check and fail by 10 or more, you also fail to gain the benefits of sleep.</div>

<table><caption>Travel Hazards</caption><thead>
<tr><th align='left'>Hazard</th><th align='center'>DC Modifier</th><th align='left'>Circumvented by</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr><td align='left'>Uncomfortable surface</td><td align='center'>+2</td><td align='left'>Bedding (bedroll)</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Light rain or snow</td><td align='center'>+2</td><td align='left'>Basic shelter (tent)</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Extreme winds</td><td align='center'>+3</td><td align='left'>Fortified shelter (a building)</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Extreme heat</td><td align='center'>+3</td><td align='left'>Fire resistance or 5x water consumption</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Heavy rain or snow</td><td align='center'>+5</td><td align='left'>Fortified shelter (a building)</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Extreme cold</td><td align='center'>+5</td><td align='left'>Heavy insulation (winter clothes and extra blankets), a source of heat, or cold resistance</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<div class='p'>Any number of these hazards can also be circumvented by a successful Survival check to find or create appropriate shelter. The DC is 10 + 5 × (number of creatures receiving benefit – number of creatures helping) + the DC modifiers of all travel hazards being circumvented. This check takes 1 hour to attempt.</div>

<h2 id="altered-rules">Altered Rules</h2>

<h3 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h3>
<div class='p'>For every 24 hours, at least 8 – your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) of them must be spent sleeping. You gain a level of exhaustion if you fail to do so.</div>

<h3 id="hiding">Hiding</h3>
<div class='p'>The official rules for hiding are vague, so here is an attempt to formalize them. The rules for visibility all still apply.</div>

<div class='p'><b>A creature automatically knows your location at all times <i>unless</i> you are either Hidden from or Unknown to that creature.</b></div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Unknown.</i></b> You are Unknown to a creature unless it notices or otherwise suspects your presence. This requires a (minimal) conscious effort on the part of the creature.</div>

<div class='p'>Examples:</div>
<ul><li>You are <i>not</i> Unknown to a dog tracking your scent, a diligent guard on duty, a dragon who is woken by your loud footsteps, or someone who recognizes you in a crowd
</li><li>You <i>may</i> be Unknown to a drunken guard, a sleeping dragon, or a stranger in a busy street
</li></ul>

<div class='p'><b><i>Hidden.</i></b> You are Hidden from a creature if that creature is unable to keep track of where you are. You cease to be Hidden from a creature that sees or hears you. You automatically reveal your location if you attack or cast a spell, unless the spell has neither verbal components nor noticeable effects emanating from you.</div>

<div class='p'>Examples:</div>
<ul><li>You are <i>not</i> Hidden from a guard that hears your armor clanking, or an earth elemental who senses your vibrations
</li><li>You <i>may</i> be Hidden from a guard whose back is turned, a sleeping dog, a passing caravan, or a bandit whose captain just shouted your location
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>Your Hide DC determines how difficult you are to detect while Hidden. The DC is equal to your passive Stealth by default. A creature whose passive Perception exceeds your Hide DC automatically detects you. If you want to remain Hidden, you must make a Stealth check the first time on a turn you move without sneaking or crawling; the result of the check becomes your Hide DC for up to 1 minute. Sneaking and crawling both take an extra foot of movement for each foot traveled.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Hide.</i></b> The Hide action allows you to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check and attempt to become Hidden from creatures that can't see you. This check becomes your Hide DC for up to 1 hour. Note that this is typically the only way to regain the Hidden status during combat.</div>

<div class='p'><b><i>Search.</i></b> The Search action allows you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check to identify the location of Hidden creatures. The DC to detect a Hidden creature is its Hide DC. If the manner of a creature's hiding would cause you to have disadvantage on this check and you don't already have it, its Hide DC is increased by 5 instead for the purpose of this check.</div>
