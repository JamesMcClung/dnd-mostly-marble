        <h1 id="rules-for-this-setting">Rules for This Setting</h1>

</li><li>that's it
</li></ul>

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<h3 id="adjacent">Adjacent</h3>

<div class='p'>"Adjacent" means "within 5 feet."</div>

<h3 id="bloodied">Bloodied</h3>

<div class='p'>A creature is called "bloodied" if its current hit points is equal to or less than half its hit point maximum. This is the point at which the creature's body shows obvious signs of harm. In general, it is possible to tell at a glance whether a creature is bloodied.</div>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<h3 id="charging">Charging</h3>

<div class='p'>The Charge action is a new action you can take in combat. Like with Dash, you gain extra movement equal to your speed (after modifiers) for the current turn. If you end your movement closer to a creature than where you started, you can make a melee weapon attack against it if it is within reach. If you make this attack, the first attack made against you before the start of your next turn has advantage.</div>

<h3 id="dropping-to-0-hit-points">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h3>

<div class='p'>When you are reduced to 0 hit points and fall unconscious, you gain a level of exhaustion.</div>

<blockquote>
<h4 id="variant-rules-injuries">Variant Rules: Injuries</h4>

<div class='p'>Consider the <a href="rules/simple-injuries.html">simple injuries</a> and <a href="rules/hardcore-injuries.html">hardcore injuries</a> variants. These variants are mutually exclusive and replace the Dropping to 0 Hit Points rule.</div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="feat-points">Feat Points</h3>

<div class='p'>See <a href="../../rules/feat-points.html">feat points</a> for an explanation of the feat point system, and <a href="feats.html">feats</a> for the actual feats available.</div>

<h3 id="flanking">Flanking</h3>

<div class='p'>If you and an ally are on opposite sides of a creature, adjacent to it, and not incapacitated, you gain a +2 bonus to melee attack rolls against it unless it cannot be flanked. Creatures with blindsight, tremorsense, or multiple heads cannot be flanked.</div>

<h3 id="grappling">Grappling</h3>

<h3 id="resurrection">Resurrection</h3>

<div class='p'>Resurrection brings a soul back to the material plane. This also provides a means for supernatural creatures to slip in with the revived soul. The DM rolls on the Unwanted Follower table when one of the following spells is cast: <i>revivify, raise dead, resurrection</i>, or <i>true resurrection.</i></div>

<div class='tableAndCaption'><span class='caption'>Unwanted Follower</span><table><thead>
<tr><th align='center'>d10</th><th align='left'>Result</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr><td align='center'>1</td><td align='left'>The spell requires an additional 1 minute to cast, and creatures of total CR at least the level of the spell appear next to the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>2-5</td><td align='left'>Creatures of total CR at least the level of the spell appear next to the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>6-9</td><td align='left'>Creatures of total CR at most the level of the spell appear next to the body.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>10</td><td align='left'>Nothing unusual happens.</td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>

<div class='p'>Both dying and coming back to life involve planar travel of the soul. A soul normally departs the plane on which it died after 1 minute. If the soul does not depart after 24 hours, it may manifest as a ghost.</div>

<h3 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h3>

<div class='p'>For every 24 hours, at least 8 – your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) of them must be spent sleeping. You gain a level of exhaustion if you fail to do so.</div>
