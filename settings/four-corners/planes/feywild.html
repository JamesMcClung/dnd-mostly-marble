            <ul>
                <li>Created <a href="/settings/four-corners/timeline.html#-15000">~15,000 years ago</a> by Pahi aided by the first <a href="/settings/four-corners/races/elf.html#fey-elves-eladrin">eladrin</a></li>
                <li>Constantly growing, but not as quickly anymore</li>
                <li>Neither distance nor time correlate 1:1 with the Material Plane, and space curves in strange ways</li>
                <li>
                    Fey Crossings connect the Material Plane with the Feywild, allowing travel between them
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distance and time behave most normally near Fey Crossings</li>
                        <li>At a Crossing, the Material Plane and the Feywild overlap perfectly, and one is in both at the same time</li>
                        <li>
                            Fey Crossings appear, disappear, and move around
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only the Prime Crossing in Verdania stays in place</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Fey creatures might traverse a Crossing and cause unrest or havoc in nearby towns</li>
                        <li>Unlucky people might traverse a Crossing by accident and get trapped in the Feywild when it disappears</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Most creatures speak <a href="/settings/four-corners/languages.html#sylvan">Sylvan</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="fey-courts">Fey Courts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Seelie Court rules most fey
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consists of eladrin and other fey nobility</li>
                        <li>Fey that acknowledge the Seelie Court are "seelie fey"</li>
                        <li>Speak <a href="/settings/four-corners/languages.html#high-sylvan">High Sylvan</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unseelie Court is a loosely bound collection of dissidents
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consists of all kinds of fey</li>
                        <li>Mostly evil</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Material creatures can cast spells, but cannot regain spell slots or other magic-based abilities
                    <ul>
                        <li>Magic items created by Material creatures do not recharge in the Feywild</li>
                        <li>
                            Warlocks are an exception: they usually cannot cast spells at all in the Feywild, and their connection to their patron is suppressed
                            <ul>
                                <li>This can be overcome if the warlock is given a focus by his or her patron, maintaining their connection and negating the Feywild's effects</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>&lt;redacted></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fey spellcasters cannot cast spells at all outside the Feywild, but most fey magic seems to work
                    <ul>
                        <li>Magic items created by fey creatures don't function while outside the Feywild</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            &lt;redacted>
            <h3 id="pahis-gifts">Pahi's Gifts</h3>
            <div class="p">Most fey, including eladrin, have unique abilities granted by Pahi that work anywhere. These abilities usually are a core part of a fey's identity. They are called Pahi's Gifts, and are powered by Pahi himself.</div>
            <h2 id="demesnes">Demesnes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Many fey have a <i>demesnes</i>, a domain over which they have some measure of control</li>
                <li>More powerful fey have larger demesnes and can exert more control over it</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="karma">Karma</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every creature in the Feywild has karma</li>
                <li>Creatures with bad karma experience bad luck, and good karma brings good luck</li>
                <li>Fey creatures can sense karma and base their social norms on it</li>
            </ul>
