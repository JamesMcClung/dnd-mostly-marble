        <h1 id="the-feywild">The Feywild</h1>
<ul><li>Created <a href="../timeline.html#-15000">~15,000 years ago</a> by Pahi aided by the first <a href="../races/elf.html#fey-elves-eladrin">eladrin</a>
</li><li>Constantly growing, but not as quickly anymore
</li><li>Neither distance nor time correlate 1:1 with the Material Plane, and space curves in strange ways
</li><li>Fey Crossings connect the Material Plane with the Feywild, allowing travel between them
<ul><li>Distance and time behave most normally near Fey Crossings
</li><li>At a Crossing, the Material Plane and the Feywild overlap perfectly, and one is in both at the same time
</li><li>Fey Crossings appear, disappear, and move around
<ul><li>Only the Prime Crossing in Verdania stays in place
</li></ul>
</li><li>Fey creatures might traverse a Crossing and cause unrest or havoc in nearby towns
</li><li>Unlucky people might traverse a Crossing by accident and get trapped in the Feywild when it disappears
</li></ul>
</li><li>Most creatures speak <a href="../languages.html#sylvan">Sylvan</a>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="fey-courts">Fey Courts</h2>
<ul><li>Seelie Court rules most fey
<ul><li>Consists of eladrin and other fey nobility
</li><li>Fey that acknowledge the Seelie Court are "seelie fey"
</li><li>Speak <a href="../languages.html#high-sylvan">High Sylvan</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Unseelie Court is a loosely bound collection of dissidents
<ul><li>Consists of all kinds of fey
</li><li>Mostly evil
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
<ul><li>Material creatures can cast spells, but cannot regain spell slots or other magic-based abilities
<ul><li>Magic items created by Material creatures do not recharge in the Feywild
</li><li>Warlocks are an exception: they usually cannot cast spells at all in the Feywild, and their connection to their patron is suppressed
<ul><li>This can be overcome if the warlock is given a focus by his or her patron, maintaining their connection and negating the Feywild's effects
</li></ul>
</li><li>&lt;redacted>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Fey spellcasters cannot cast spells at all outside the Feywild, but most fey magic seems to work
<ul><li>Magic items created by fey creatures don't function while outside the Feywild
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="pahis-gifts">Pahi's Gifts</h3>
<div class='p'>Most fey, including eladrin, have unique abilities granted by Pahi that work anywhere. These abilities usually are a core part of a fey's identity. They are called Pahi's Gifts, and are powered by Pahi himself.</div>

<h2 id="demesnes">Demesnes</h2>
<ul><li>Many fey have a <i>demesnes</i>, a domain over which they have some measure of control
</li><li>More powerful fey have larger demesnes and can exert more control over it
</li></ul>

<h2 id="karma">Karma</h2>
<ul><li>Every creature in the Feywild has karma
</li><li>Creatures with bad karma experience bad luck, and good karma brings good luck
</li><li>Fey creatures can sense karma and base their social norms on it
</li></ul>
