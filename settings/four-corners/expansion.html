It is almost purely a human endeavor. Expansion only became viable in the absence of Leviathan, the <a href="primordials.html">Primordial</a> of Water. In the century and a half since the <a href="binding.html">binding</a> of Leviathan, humans have established trading colonies on all major continents. Some less scrupulous humans indulge in the slave trade, primarily dealing in dwarves and other humans.</div> <div class="p">The Primordial of Air, Typhon, remains a looming threat to ships. Typhon's storms are more than capable of sinking vessels of any size. But with Leviathan bound, it is possible to escape a storm by magically submerging underwater. Not all captains can afford the service of a mage powerful enough to perform this maneuver, however, and many lives are lost every year to Typhon's wrath.</div> <div class="p">To fully realize the dream of expansion, Typhon must be bound. The Lord of Storms is much more evasive than even Leviathan, so it may be decades or more before this becomes feasible.</div> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
