            <div class="p">There are three continents, one pseudocontinent, and countless islands of varying sizes. The continents loosely split the world ocean into three sections. The following table gives an overview of the world, but see below for more detailed descriptions.</div>

The eastern valley is a temperate rainforest with many rivers, yielding to mangrove swamps at the coast. The northern valley has many fjords and freezes in the winter. The west is an expansive desert full of canyons and plateaus with a shrubland coast. An unusually deep and intricate network of subterranean tunnels spans the continent.</td></tr>

A short but wide mountain forms its heart. The lower northern slopes of the mountain are tropical rainforest all the way to the shores. It is more temperate at higher altitudes and in the south. Both north and south have an otherwordly aura to them: the north glamorous, the south sinister. Many tropical islands are scattered in and around the bight. Coral reefs are abundant as well.</td></tr>

            <h3 id="ata">Ata</h3>
            <div class="p"><i>Main page: <a href="world/ata.html">Ata</a></i></div>
            <div class="p">Ata is the second-largest continent, roughly shaped like a 'σ'. A horizontal mountain range divides most of the continent into northern and southern halves. North of the mountains are taiga and then tundra. The bulk of the continent below the mountains is grassland. Deciduous tree cover increases closer to the coast. The east coast is exceptionally fertile, and Humans and Orcs have fought many wars over it.</div>
            <div class="p">Humans currently occupy most of the south and parts of the northern coast, leaving the slopes of the mountains to the Orcs.</div>
            <h3 id="verdania">Verdania</h3>
            <div class="p"><i>Main page: <a href="world/verdania.html">Verdania</a></i></div>
            <div class="p">Verdania, the smallest continent, is dominated by colossal shield volcano called Verdoa. The sea enters the volcano's caldera in the north, filling it and giving Verdania its lunate shape. </div>
            <h2 id="islands-isles-archipelagos">Islands, Isles, & Archipelagos</h2>
            <h3 id="dragon-island">Dragon Island</h3>
            <div class="p">Home to the Dragonborn and Kobolds, and often visited by dragons. A lush jungle covers the island except for the rims of three large calderas. The volcanos on the island itself are believed to be dormant, but earthquakes are still common and new isles are always on the rise to the south.</div>
            <div class="p">The isles and rocky outcroppings in the surrounding waters make landing a large ship here impossible. The steep cliffs on the shore provide a second natural barrier to invasion. The volcanic rock is sharp and crumbly, so the only way up is to fly or navigate the many lava tubes. The latter option could result in the discovery of a Kobold den before promptly ending.</div>
