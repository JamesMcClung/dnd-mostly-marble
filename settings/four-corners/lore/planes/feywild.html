growing, but not as quickly anymore</li> <li>Neither distance nor time correlate 1:1 with the Material Plane, and space curves in strange ways</li> <li> Fey Crossings connect the Material Plane with the Feywild, allowing travel between them <ul> <li>Distance and time behave most normally near Fey Crossings</li> <li>At a Crossing, the Material Plane and the Feywild overlap perfectly, and one is in both at the same time</li> <li> Fey Crossings appear, disappear, and move around <ul> <li>Only the Prime Crossing in Verdania stays in place</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fey creatures might traverse a Crossing and cause unrest or havoc in nearby towns</li> <li>Unlucky people might traverse a Crossing by accident and get trapped in the Feywild when it disappears</li> </ul> </li> <li>Most creatures

recharge in the Feywild</li> <li> Warlocks are an exception: they usually can't cast spells at all in the Feywild, and their connection to their patron is suppressed <ul> <li>This can be overcome if the warlock is given a focus by his or her patron, maintaining their connection and negating the Feywild's effects</li> </ul> </li> <li>&lt;redacted></li> </ul> </li> <li> Fey spellcasters can't cast
