The continents loosely split the world ocean into three sections. The following table gives an overview of the world, but see below for more detailed descriptions.</div> <div class="tableAndCaption"> <div class="tableWrapper"> <table> <thead> <tr><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Name</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Type</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Location</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Denizens</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Geography & Climate</span></th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td align="left">Ata</td><td align="left">Continent</td><td align="left">West</td><td align="left">Humans, Orcs</td><td align="left">The second-largest continent, shaped like a 'σ'. Mountains separate taiga and tundra in the North from savanna in the South, with temperate deciduous forests along the coast.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Gabroria</td><td align="left">Continent</td><td align="left">Northeast</td><td align="left">Dwarves, Gnomes, Goblins, Goliaths</td><td align="left">The largest continent, with a colossal mountain range shaped like a backwards 'y'. The eastern valley is a temperate rainforest with many rivers, yielding to mangrove swamps at the coast. The northern valley has many fjords and freezes in the winter. The west is an expansive desert full of canyons and plateaus with a shrubland coast. An unusually deep and intricate network of subterranean tunnels spans the continent.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Verdania</td><td align="left">Continent</td><td align="left">Far east</td><td align="left">Elves, Soraska, Firbolgs</td><td align="left">The smallest continent, shaped like a slight crescent moon opening northwards, forming a bight. A short but wide mountain forms its heart. The lower northern slopes of the mountain are tropical rainforest all the way to the shores. It is more temperate at higher altitudes and in the south. Both north and south have an otherwordly aura to them: the north glamorous, the south sinister. Many tropical islands are scattered in and around the bight. Coral reefs are abundant as well.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">The Pyrmies</td><td align="left">Archipelago</td><td align="left">Southwest of Ata</td><td align="left">Halflings</td><td align="left">A collection of large islands off the coast of Ata. Rocky outer islands protect the hilly, partially wooded inner islands. The islands to the south are less protected and have sunk slightly, creating swamplands. The waters between the islands are calm, shallow, and teeming with life.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">The Iceplains</td><td align="left">Polar ice cap</td><td align="left">North pole</td><td align="left">Humans</td><td align="left">A desolate expanse of floating ice broken up by the occasional iceberg. Below the thick ice is an incredibly deep sea. Humans have fashioned homes inside the ice sheets to keep out of the frigid winds. They guard the bound Primordial of Water, Leviathan.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Dragon Island</td><td align="left">Island</td><td align="left">Far south of Gabroria</td><td align="left">Dragonborn, Kobolds</td><td align="left">A huge, lush volcanic island shaped like a teardrop and surrounded by many jagged islets.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Alanta's Trench</td><td align="left">Deep-sea trench</td><td align="left">?</td><td align="left">Triton</td><td align="left">?</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <h2 id="continents">Continents</h2> <h3 id="ata">Ata</h3> <div class="p"><i>Main page: <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/world/ata.html">Ata</a></i></div> <div class="p">Ata is the second-largest continent, roughly shaped like a 'σ'. A horizontal mountain range divides most of the continent into northern and southern halves. North of the mountains are taiga and then tundra. The bulk of the continent below the mountains is grassland. Deciduous tree cover increases closer to the coast. The east coast is exceptionally fertile, and Humans and Orcs have fought many wars over it.</div> <div class="p">Humans currently occupy most of the south and parts of the northern coast, leaving the slopes of the mountains to the Orcs.</div> <h3 id="verdania">Verdania</h3> <div class="p"><i>Main page: <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/world/verdania.html">Verdania</a></i></div> <div class="p">Verdania, the smallest continent, is dominated by colossal shield volcano called Verdoa. The sea enters the volcano's caldera in the north, filling it and giving Verdania its lunate shape. </div> <h2 id="islands-isles-archipelagos">Islands, Isles, & Archipelagos</h2> <h3 id="dragon-island">Dragon Island</h3> <div class="p">Home to the Dragonborn and Kobolds, and often visited by dragons. A lush jungle covers the island except for the rims of three large calderas. The volcanos on the island itself are believed to be dormant, but earthquakes are still common and new isles are always on the rise to the south.</div> <div class="p">The isles and rocky outcroppings in the surrounding waters make landing a large ship here impossible. The steep cliffs on the shore provide a second natural barrier to invasion. The volcanic rock is sharp and crumbly, so the only way up is to fly or navigate the many lava tubes. The latter option could result in the discovery of a Kobold den before promptly ending.</div> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
