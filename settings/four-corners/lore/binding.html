Originally invented by a dwarvish wizard, binding was first used commercially by dwarves to dig tunnels and mine gemstones. Gnomes later took up the craft as well.</div> <div class="p">The bindings of the <a href="/settings/four-corners/lore/primordials.html">primordials</a> of earth, fire, and water represent the pinnacle of magical accomplishment. The bound primordials are inactive and thus do not contribute to natural disasters, but are too powerful to be controlled. They can be used in a limited capacity. For example, the Dwarves use the heat from Shaitan to power their greatest forges.</div> <h2 id="spells">Spells</h2> <div class="p">There are two binding spells: <i>lesser bind</i>, invented first, and <i>greater bind</i>, used on the Primordials. Several other spells were based upon these two spells, including <i>conjure elemental</i>, <i>planar binding</i>, and <i>imprisonment</i>.</div> <div class="p"><i>Lesser bind</i> is available to artificers, bards, druids, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. <i>Greater bind</i> is available only to wizards.</div> <h2 id="opposition">Opposition</h2> <div class="p">Some individuals, including most elves and druids, oppose the binding of the primordials on the grounds that it is against nature to do so.</div> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
