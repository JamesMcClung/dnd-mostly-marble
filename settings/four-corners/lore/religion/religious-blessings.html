When a creature with natural darkvision starts its turn in bright sunlight created by the empowered spell, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is frightened of the source of the light until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 1 hour. Creatures that have darkvision solely due to magic, such as via the <i>darkvision</i> spell, are also immune to this effect. Once you empower a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you next witness dawn.</div> <h2 id="purging-dawn">Purging Dawn</h2> <div class="p"><i>Tier 5 Sonnentum blessing</i></div> <div class="p">You can cast the spell <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="spells#greater_restoration" onclick='handleAnchorClick("spells#greater_restoration", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("spells#greater_restoration", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("spells#greater_restoration", event)'><i>greater restoration</i></span> once with this feature, requiring no components.

To do so, you must use a pointy or sharp object, such as a dagger, to deal 1 point of piercing or slashing damage to yourself; the spell fails and is wasted if you take no damage. You deal this damage as part of the action used to cast the spell, immediately before it takes effect. This damage does not cause you to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.</div> <h2 id="listen-to-the-beasts">Listen to the Beasts</h2> <div class="p"><i>Tier 2 Shamalism blessing</i></div> <div class="p">You can cast the spell <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="spells#speak_with_animals" onclick='handleAnchorClick("spells#speak_with_animals", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("spells#speak_with_animals", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("spells#speak_with_animals", event)'><i>speak with animals</i></span> at will.</div> <h2 id="shamalist-path">Shamalist Path</h2> <div class="p"><i>Tier 3 Shamalism blessing</i></div> <div class="p">Choose the Path of Sorcery or the Path of Strength. You gain a benefit based on your decision:</div> <div class="p"><i>Path of Sorcery.</i> When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using your own blood as a spellcasting focus while you are bloodied, you can increase the level of the spell by 1. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you recover all your missing hit points.</div> <div class="p"><i>Path of Strength.</i> While you are bloodied, you can use a minor action to spend a Hit Die and heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution score, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). You can use this minor action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain expended uses when you recover all your missing hit points. Additionally, you can use Constitution as the spellcasting ability of any spell you cast using your own blood as a spellcasting focus.</div> <h2 id="no-drop-wasted">No Drop Wasted</h2> <div class="p"><i>Tier 4 Shamalism blessing</i></div> <div class="p">If you are bloodied after taking damage from a source other than casting a spell via Power of Blood, you can use a reaction to do one of the following, based on your Shamalist Path:</div> <div class="p"><i>Path of Sorcery.</i> Cast a cantrip or 1st-level spell with a casting time of 1 standard action. Your own blood from the triggering damage is the spellcasting focus for this spell.</div> <div class="p"><i>Path of Strength.</i> Move up to half your speed and then make a melee or ranged weapon attack with advantage. If you move, you have resistance to all damage during the movement.</div> <div class="p">Once you use this reaction, you can't use it again until you recover all your missing hit points.</div> <h2 id="blood-bond">Blood Bond</h2> <div class="p"><i>Tier 5 Shamalism blessing</i></div> <div class="p">You can create a blood bond between yourself and another creature. As a standard action while you are bloodied, you can touch another bloodied creature, which must succeed on a Constution saving throw or suffer a magical effect based on your Shamalist Path:</div> <div class="p"><i>Path of Sorcery.</i> The target's hit point maximum becomes its current hit points indefinitely. This effect is both a disease and a curse. Also on a failed save, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the target's current hit points. These temporary hit points go away if the effect on the target ends.</div> <div class="p"><i>Path of Strength.</i> The target may willingly fail the saving throw. On a failed save, both you and the target are cursed. While cursed in this way and within 60 feet of each other, you and the target share hit points. Add each of your hit point maxima and current hit points to determine your new, shared hit point maximum and current hit points. Whenever one of your hit points would change, the hit points of the other changes too, so they are always the same. The curse ends immediately after your shared current hit points is reduced to 0 or lower, or if you and the target are ever on a different plane of existence. If the curse ends on one of you, it ends on both of you. When it ends, your hit point maxima return to normal, and you each get half of your shared current hit points.</div> <div class="p">Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead are immune to this feature. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you are reduced to 0 hit points, fail a <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/conditions.html#dying">death saving throw</a>, and then recover all your missing hit points.</div> </div> </div> <script src="/js/sortTable.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/search.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/popup-data.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/popup.js" defer="defer"></script> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
