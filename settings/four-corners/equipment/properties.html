Drawing the ammunition from a <a href="/settings/four-corners/equipment.html#quiver">quiver</a>, <a href="/settings/four-corners/equipment.html#case-crossbow-bolt">case</a>, or other container is part of the attack.

The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range.
