        <h1 id="binding">Binding</h1>

<p><i>Binding</i> is the magical act of enslaving or imprisoning an elemental. Originally invented by a Gnomish wizard, binding was first used commercially by Dwarves to dig tunnels and mine gemstones. Humans later took up the craft as well.</p>

<p>The bindings of the <a href="primordials.html">Primordials</a> of Earth, Fire, and Water represent the pinnacle of magical accomplishment. The bound Primordials are inactive and thus do not contribute to natural disasters, but are too powerful to be controlled. They can be used in a limited capacity. For example, the Dwarves use the heat from the Primordial of Fire to power their greatest furnaces.</p>

<h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>

<p>There are two binding spells: <i>lesser bind</i>, invented first, and <i>greater bind</i>, used on the Primordials. Several other spells were based upon these two spells, including <i>conjure elemental</i>, <i>planar binding</i>, and <i>imprisonment</i>.</p>

<p><i>Lesser bind</i> is available to artificers, bards, druids, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. _Greater bind_is available only to wizards.</p>

<h2 id="opposition">Opposition</h2>

<p>Some individuals, including most Elves and druids, oppose the binding of the primordials on the grounds that it is against nature to do so.</p>
