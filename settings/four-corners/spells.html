<p>Below are new spells available in this setting. If a spell is not on any spell list, it cannot be obtained via any means except when specifically granted. For example, the only way to cast <a href="#withering-wounds"><i>withering wounds</i></a> is if you are a <a href="races/tiefling.html">tiefling</a> with the <a href="feats.html#amalgamated-chaos">Amalgamated Chaos</a> feat.</p>

    <p>With a cold glare, hellish flames burst from the creature that damaged you. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the creature also cannot attack you or target you with harmful abilities or magical effects until the start of your next turn.</p>

    <p>You create a magical zone to enforce your authority in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.</p>

<p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.</p>

<p>Addtionally, you can cast <i>command</i> at will targeting any number of creatures within the zone.</p>

    <p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage and begins to wither.</p>

<p>While withering, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns or take 1d10 necrotic damage. The withering ends on a successful save or after 1 minute. The spell also ends early if <i>remove curse</i> is cast on the target.</p>

    <p>A number of humanoids up to your proficiency bonus of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While a target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.</p>

<p>A charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose.</p>

<p>A target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.</p>

<p>On your subsequent turns, you must use your action or bonus action to maintain control over the targets, or the spell ends. Also, a target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature. The spell also ends early on a creature if <i>remove curse</i> is cast on it.</p>
