<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="human">Human</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Humans are the most diverse race. Some groups may hone one or more particular abilities, but there's no telling what a random human is good at.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Humans reach adulthood at around 20 and old age at 70 years. Few live longer than a century.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Humans generally share an alignment with their peers, which in turn varies across cultures and generations. A human can easily take on any alignment.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write the language of your upbringing and one other language of your choice.
  <h4 id="common-human">Common Human</h4><p><strong><em>Personal Talent.</em></strong> Humans have a knack for picking up skills that may not even be useful to them. You gain proficiency in one skill or tool of your choice. At 3rd level, you gain expertise in that skill or tool.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Personal Disposition.</em></strong> Choose one of the following benefits:</p> <ul type='a'> <li><em>Collaborative.</em> When you use the Help action to give a creature advantage on an ability check, the creature can add 1d4 to the check (or 1d6 if your Personal Talent would apply to the check). If the check fails, that creature cannot benefit from this feature again until it finishes a long rest.</li> <li><em>Aggressive.</em> When you fail an ability check, you can add 1d4 to the roll (or 1d6 if your Personal Talent applied to the check), potentially turning the failure into a success. However, if you ever fail a check that your Personal Talent applies to or a check that you used this feature on, you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</li> <li><em>Stubborn.</em> When you make an ability check, you can add 1d4 to the roll (or 1d6 if your Personal Talent applies to the check). If the check succeeds, you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</li></ul>
  <p><strong><em>Worldly.</em></strong> You can pick an additional background.</p>
<h4 id="ogof">Ogof</h4><p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your unusually large eyes confer darkvision out to a range of 60 ft.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Soulsight.</em></strong> You can sense the presence and location of magic within 30 feet of you when you are not incapacitated. This ability cannot penetrate through 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.</p> <p>As an action, you can focus your attention on magic you can sense in this way. If you do so, you magically see a faint aura outlining the shape of the creature, object, or area bearing the magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses after a long rest.
  <p><strong><em>Overchannel.</em></strong> Once when you cast a spell using a spell slot of 5th level or lower, you can can increase the level of the spell by 1. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
