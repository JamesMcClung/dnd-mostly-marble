        <h1 id="humans">Humans</h1>
<p>Humans are native to Ata, where they compete with Orcs for control over the plains.</p>
<ul>
<li>Biggest seafaring race by far. Hobgoblins are the only other race to even have seaworthy vessels.</li>
<li>Even before sea travel was possible, human mages traveled the world and facilitated cultural exchange between Humans, Dwarves, and Elves.</li>
<li>Humans have established at least one colony on all three continents, plus one settlement on the Ice Plains and several outposts in the Pyrmies.</li>
<li>Many ethnicities exist, but the two biggest are the Etelaan and the Sonnern.
<ul>
<li>Etelaan: bronze-skinned, black-haired, and brown-eyed southwesterners who currently control most of the south and west
<ul>
<li>language based on Finnish</li>
<li>shorter on average</li>
<li>exceptionally collaborative, building a strong network of schools, hospitals, and libraries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sonnern: light/tan-skinned, dirty-blond-haired, and blue-eyed easterners who currently control the east coast
<ul>
<li>language based on German</li>
<li>militaristic, ruled by merchant-lords controlling armies of mercenaries</li>
<li>worship the Sun, observing its rise every day</li>
<li>originally from northeast of Ata</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tenga: dark-skinned, bald, amber-eyed plainsmen
<ul>
<li>language based on Indonesian</li>
<li>once very powerful and responsible for many ruins across the plains</li>
<li>decimated after bad earthquakes ruined their defenses and orcs invaded</li>
<li>continue to live in ruins, trying to relearn lost secrets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fune: brown-skinned, black/gray-haired, dark-eyed southerners
<ul>
<li>language based on Japanese</li>
<li>taller on average</li>
<li>the original seafarers, but Etelaan and Sonnern copied them</li>
<li>chose to be nomadic seafarers (and/or pirates) rather than be Etelaan subjects</li>
<li>primarily sail in the Pyrmies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shamal: light-skinned, dark-brown-haired, blue-eyed northerners
<ul>
<li>language based on Arabic</li>
<li>pushed out of northlands by Orcs, and now live in the fringes of Sonnern territory</li>
<li>rarely have red hair, which is taken as a sign of good favor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ogof: pale-skinned, blond/white-haired, and red-eyed cave dwellers in the mountains
<ul>
<li>language based on Welsh</li>
<li>can't stand bright light, especially sunlight</li>
<li>persecuted by Sonnern, now only isolated tribes remain in the east</li>
<li>a great Ogof city is rumored to exist in the western mountains</li>
<li>more magically adept on average</li>
