<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="human">Human</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Humans are the most diverse race. Some groups may hone one or more particular abilities, but there's no telling what a random human is good at.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Humans reach adulthood at around 20 and old age at 70 years. Few live longer than a century.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Humans generally share an alignment with their peers, which in turn varies across cultures and generations. A human can easily take on any alignment.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write the language of your upbringing and one other language of your choice.
  <h4 id="common-human">Common Human</h4><p><strong><em>Personal Calling.</em></strong> Humans are known for dedicating themselves to a skill or trade and perfecting it. You gain expertise in one skill or tool of your choice.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Perfected Skill.</em></strong> Before making a check to which the expertise granted by your Personal Calling applies, you can opt to not roll the d20. If you do, treat the check as if you had rolled a 15. If the roll would have been made with advantage or disadvantage, instead treat the check as if you had rolled a 20 or 10, respectively.</p> <p>Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Adaptable Talent.</em></strong> Pick an ability score for each of the following categories: saving throws, attack rolls, and ability checks. For each category, you gain a +1 bonus to rolls using the chosen ability. Each time you level up or with 1 week of training for 8 hours each day, you can change the chosen ability score of one category.</p>
<h4 id="ogof">Ogof</h4><p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your unusually large eyes confer darkvision out to a range of 60 ft.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Soulsight.</em></strong> You can sense the presence and location of magic within 30 feet of you when you are not incapacitated. This ability cannot penetrate through 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead.</p> <p>As an action, you can focus your attention on magic you can sense in this way. If you do so, you magically see a faint aura outlining the shape of the creature, object, or area bearing the magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses after a long rest.
  <p><strong><em>Heightened Casting.</em></strong> When you cast a spell of 1st to 5th level, you can can increase the level of the spell by 1. The resulting spell level cannot exceed half your level (rounded up). You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
