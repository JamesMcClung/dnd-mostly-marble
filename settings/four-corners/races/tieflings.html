        <h1 id="tieflings">Tieflings</h1>
<p>A tiefling, which translates roughly to "low one" in Sonnern, is a cursed being. A child of any race may be born a tiefling, and virtually any parent would abandon such a child as soon as the curse became evident. Tieflings are shunned by most people due to prejudices and fears—which may be justified—concerning them. It is well-known that tiefling behave erratically, and many people believe that their supernatural visage and powers mark them as evil.</p>
<h2 id="the-curse">The Curse</h2>
<p>The Tiefling's Curse usually manifests as oddly colored skin, hair, and eyes, with the eyes being completely monochromatic. These traits may not appear until the tiefling child is a year old. In extreme cases, a tiefling can have horns, sharp teeth, claws instead of nails, slits for a nose, or even a tail; these traits appear much sooner, even before birth.</p>
<p>The true impact of the Curse is mental, not physical. A tiefling gets impulses to act either chaotically or orderly, and feels discomfort from resisting these impulses. The impulses get stronger with age. When a tiefling fully succombs to the Curse, they act solely on these impulses for few years before entering a coma and ultimately dying.</p>
<p>Some tieflings use magic to thwart the Curse and banish the impulses entirely. This comes at the cost of losing certain powers, but is certainly preferable to insanity.</p>

  <h3 id="tiefling">Tiefling</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Tieflings generally inherit the physical attributes of their parents. They often have rough childhoods and learn to be quick, cunning, or charismatic to survive.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> All tieflings eventually succomb to the Tiefling's Curse, reducing their lifespan to about two-thirds of what would otherwise be expected from their heritage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Atrophic tiefling are supernaturally drawn to freedom and chaos, while leguleian tieflings are discomforted by lies and broken laws. The vicious upbringing of many tieflings may exacerbate these tendencies. Some tieflings resist, although it takes constant effort and gets more difficult with age.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Inherited Traits.</em></strong> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</p>

The lifting of the Curse has the following effects:</p> <ul><li>You do not feel impulses towards chaos or order.</li> <li>You do not feel discomfort when chaos or order is not upheld.</li> <li>You cannot cast spells using your Leguleian Spells or Atrophic Spells trait.</li></ul> <p>If <i>remove curse</i> was cast at a higher level, the Curse is lifted for longer: 1 day at 5th or 6th level, 1 month at 7th or 8th level, or 1 year at 9th level.</p>
