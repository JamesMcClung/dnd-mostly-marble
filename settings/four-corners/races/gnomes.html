<p>It is unclear whether Gnomes are originally from Verdania or Gabroria. They must have found a way to cross the ocean before recorded history, but the means by which they did so–by magic or ships—is unknown. &lt;redacted></p>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="gnome">Gnome</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Gnome physiology varies more than that of a typical race, but the majority of gnomes have deft hands and quick wits. Dexterity and Intelligence are most commonly high in gnomes, although rock gnomes exhibit impressive Strength and Constitution just as often.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Gnomes mature quickly and reach adulthood by 18. They live about as long as humans but reach old age sooner, at age 60.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most gnomes are free-spirited and ambitious in their own way. This usually manifests as a chaotic tilt, but plenty of gnomes ardently hold to law or personal codes. There is so much variation that any alignment is likely.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Small. Gnomes average about 3 feet high.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Gnome Cunning.</em></strong> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Creative Spark.</em></strong> Before you make an ability check, you can add 1d4 and subtract 2 from the result. The size of the die and the penalty increase as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Creative Spark Size table. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), regaining expended uses after a long rest.</p><h6 id="creative-spark-size">Creative Spark Size</h6> <table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Die</th><th>Penalty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-4</td><td>1d4</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>5-8</td><td>1d6</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>9-12</td><td>1d8</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>1d10</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>17-20</td><td>1d12</td><td>-6</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <h4 id="rock-tinker-gnome">Rock (Tinker) Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write one dialect of Gabrorian Gnomish. Gabrorian Gnomish has many dialects–more than one per city–and some are only barely mutually intelligible.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Small but Sturdy.</em></strong> You ignore the heavy property of weapons with which you are proficient.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alert to Magic.</em></strong> You know the <i>identify</i> spell and can cast it as an action without material components a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="rot-gnome">Rot Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write the Tiris Vale dialect of Gabrorian Gnomish. This dialect is extreme and incorporates lisps into some words, as Rot Gnomes often have speech impediments.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Partially Undead.</em></strong> You register as undead to abilities that detect undead, and healing that can't normally affect an undead creature restores half as many hit points to you.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your undead nature grants you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Undead Resilience.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance against poison and necrotic damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Dead Flesh.</em></strong> Some of your body is decayed and unfeeling. Whenever you take damage of a type other than radiant or psychic, reduce that damage by 1 after applying any resistances and vulnerabilities. However, your hit point maximum decreases by 1, and it decreases by 1 every time you gain a level. This cannot reduce your hit point maximum below 1.</p>
<h4 id="sand-gnome">Sand Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Sand Gnomish. Sand Gnomish is a close cousin to standard Gabrorian Gnomish but lacks Dwarvish influence.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Eye for Illusions.</em></strong> You have advantage on Perception and Investigation checks to identify magical illusions as such, as the illusion magic leaves a distinctive impression on your mind. You can use this to faintly sense creatures that are magically invisible. Rather than automatically failing on ability checks that require seeing a magically invisible creature, you just have disadvantage and cannot gain advantage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Calloused Mind.</em></strong> You have resistance against psychic damage.</p>
<h4 id="fey-gnome">Fey Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Fey Gnomish and Sylvan. Sylvan is the common language of the Feywild and shares some vocabulary Fey Gnomish.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Your creature type is Humanoid and Fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Slip Away.</em></strong> When a creature you can see is about to attack you, you can use a reaction to magically turn invisible until the end of your next turn, potentially causing the attack roll to have disadvantage. The invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature once, regaining the ability to do so after a short or long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Born Prankster.</em></strong> You know the <i>prestidigitation</i> cantrip. Fey Gnomes are known to use this spell to great effect in practical jokes.</p>
<h4 id="forest-gnome">Forest Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write either Verdanian Gnomish or a unique dialect of Fey Gnomish depending on whether you grew up in Verdania or Gabroria, respectively. Like Fey Gnomish, Verdanian Gnomish has many words in common with Sylvan.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speak with Small Beasts.</em></strong> Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts. You have advantage on Animal Handling checks made on such beasts.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Natural Illusionist.</em></strong> You know the <i>minor illusion</i> cantrip and can cast it without material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>

  <p class="card-subheader"><em>Prerequisite: Forest Gnome</em></p>

  <p>You gain the ability to make a special bond between yourself and a beast. The beast must be willing and Small or smaller. You can create the bond over the course of an hour, which may be during a short or long rest. You must be within 5 feet of the beast throughout the process as you bond with it. Afterwards, the beast gains the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>Whenever the beast finishes a short or long rest, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your level.</li><li>The beast learns a random spell on the Beast Spell table. It uses your Intelligence modifier as its spellcasting ability, it uses your level for cantrips, and it can cast the spell at will and without material components. If the spell requires verbal or somatic components, the beast's squeaks, tail wagging, or other behaviors are sufficient.</li></ul> <p>You can have a number of bonded beasts equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one). If a beast dies, its bond breaks, and you regain the ability to bond a new beast 1 week after its death.</p> <h6 id="beast-spell">Beast Spell</h6> <table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Spell</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>01-06</td><td><i>dancing lights</i></td></tr><tr><td>07-12</td><td><i>druidcraft</i></td></tr><tr><td>13-18</td><td><i>mold earth</i></td></tr><tr><td>19-24</td><td><i>shape water</i></td></tr><tr><td>25-30</td><td><i>control flames</i></td></tr><tr><td>31-36</td><td><i>gust</i> (3/day)</td></tr><tr><td>37-42</td><td><i>friends</i></td></tr><tr><td>43-48</td><td><i>message</i></td></tr><tr><td>49-54</td><td><i>mage hand</i></td></tr><tr><td>55-60</td><td><i>spare the dying</i></td></tr><tr><td>61-64</td><td><i>primal savagery</i></td></tr><tr><td>65-68</td><td><i>thunderclap</i></td></tr><tr><td>69-72</td><td><i>poison spray</i> (3/day)</td></tr><tr><td>73-76</td><td><i>vicious mockery</i> (3/day)</td></tr><tr><td>77-79</td><td><i>sanctuary</i> (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>80-82</td><td><i>expeditious retreat</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>83-85</td><td><i>hunter's mark</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>86-87</td><td><i>cause fear</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>88-89</td><td><i>thunderwave</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>90-91</td><td><i>cure wounds</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>92-93</td><td><i>barkskin</i> (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>94-95</td><td><i>spider climb</i> (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td><i>alter self</i></td></tr><tr><td>97</td><td><i>invisibility</i> (1/day, self only)</td></tr><tr><td>98</td><td><i>dragon's breath</i> (1/day, self only)</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td><i>fly</i> (1/day, self only)</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>Roll twice more, rerolling further 00s</td></tr></tbody></table></p>
