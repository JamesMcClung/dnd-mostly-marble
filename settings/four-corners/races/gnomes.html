        <h1 id="gnomes">Gnomes</h1>
<p>It is unclear whether Gnomes are originally from Verdania or Gabroria. They must have found a way to cross the ocean before recorded history, but the means by which they did so–by magic or ships—is unknown. &lt;redacted></p>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="gnome">Gnome</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Gnome physiology varies more than that of a typical race, but the majority of gnomes have deft hands and quick wits. Dexterity and Intelligence are most commonly high in gnomes, although rock gnomes exhibit impressive Strength and Constitution just as often.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Gnomes mature quickly and reach adulthood by 18. They live about as long as humans but reach old age sooner, at age 60.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most gnomes are free-spirited and ambitious in their own way. This usually manifests as a chaotic tilt, but plenty of gnomes ardently hold to law or personal codes. There is so much variation that any alignment is likely.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write one dialect of Gnomish. The three main dialects are Gabrorian, Verdanian, and Fey. They are just barely mutually intelligible, although some sub-dialects are too extreme to be understood by most outsiders.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Small. Gnomes average about 3 feet high.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Gnome Cunning.</em></strong> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Spark of Creativity.</em></strong> Before you make an ability check, you can add 1d4 and subtract 2 from the result. The size of both the die and the reduction increase by 1 each time your proficiency increases, to a maximum of 1d12 minus 6.</p><p>You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).</p>
  <h4 id="rock-tinker-gnome">Rock (Tinker) Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Small but Sturdy.</em></strong> You ignore the heavy property of weapons.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Instant Attunement.</em></strong> You can attune to a magic item as an action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. You may use Siphon Magic on that object as part of the same action. You regain expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Siphon Magic.</em></strong> When you are attuned to a magic item that has charges that are partially restored once per day (such as by gaining 1d3 every dawn), you can use an action to use up some of its charges. Roll as if the item were regaining charges, but reduce the number of charges by that amount instead. If this would reduce the number of charges to below 0, no charges are lost and nothing happens. Otherwise, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level.</p>
<h4 id="rot-gnome">Rot Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Partially Undead.</em></strong> You register as undead to abilities that detect undead. Healing that can't normally affect an undead creature restores half as many hit points to you.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Like many undead, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Undead Resilience.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance against poison and necrotic damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Dead Flesh.</em></strong> You are numb to pain that others would recoil at. When you take damage while concentrating, the DC to maintain concentration is 7 or a third of the damage you take, whichever is higher. However, your hit point maximum decreases by 1, and it decreases by 1 every time you gain a level. This cannot reduce your hit point maximum below 1.</p>
<h4 id="sand-gnome">Sand Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Eye for Illusions.</em></strong> You have advantage on Perception and Investigation checks to identify magical illusions as such, as the illusion magic leaves a distinctive impression on your mind. You can use this to faintly sense creatures that are magically invisible. Rather than automatically failing on ability checks that require seeing an invisible creature, you just have disadvantage and cannot gain advantage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Calloused Mind.</em></strong> You have resistance against psychic damage.</p>
<h4 id="fey-gnome">Fey Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Sylvan. Sylvan is the common language of the Feywild.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Your creature type is Humanoid and Fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed. While you are charmed, you can make a saving throw to end the effect at the end of each of your turns.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Slip Away.</em></strong> When a creature you can see is about to make an attack roll targeting you, you can use a reaction to magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn, potentially giving the attack roll disadvantage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once), regaining expended uses after a long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Innate Prankster.</em></strong> As a natural connoisseur of practical jokes, you know the <i>prestidigitation</i> cantrip.</p>
<h4 id="forest-gnome">Forest Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Speak with Small Beasts.</em></strong> Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Natural Illusionist.</em></strong> You know the <i>minor illusion</i> cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Beast Friends.</em></strong> You can forge a special bond between yourself and a friendly, willing Small or smaller beast over the course of an hour, which may be during a short or long rest. You must be within 5 feet of the beast throughout the process as you bond with it. Afterwards, the beast gains the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>Whenever the beast finishes a short or long rest, it gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your level.</li><li>The beast learns a random spell on the Beast Spell table. It uses your Intelligence modifier as its spellcasting ability, it uses your level for cantrips, and it can cast the spell at will and without material components. If the spell requires verbal or somatic components, the beast's squeaks, tail wagging, or other behaviors are sufficient.</li></ul> <p>You can have a number of bonded beasts equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum one). If a beast dies, its bond breaks, and you regain the ability to bond a new beast 1 week after its death.</p> <h5 id="beast-spell">Beast Spell</h5> <table><thead><tr><th>d100</th><th>Spell</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>01-06</td><td><i>dancing lights</i></td></tr><tr><td>07-12</td><td><i>druidcraft</i></td></tr><tr><td>13-18</td><td><i>mold earth</i></td></tr><tr><td>19-24</td><td><i>shape water</i></td></tr><tr><td>25-30</td><td><i>control flames</i></td></tr><tr><td>31-36</td><td><i>gust</i> (3/day)</td></tr><tr><td>37-42</td><td><i>friends</i></td></tr><tr><td>43-48</td><td><i>message</i></td></tr><tr><td>49-54</td><td><i>mage hand</i></td></tr><tr><td>55-60</td><td><i>spare the dying</i></td></tr><tr><td>61-64</td><td><i>primal savagery</i></td></tr><tr><td>65-68</td><td><i>thunderclap</i></td></tr><tr><td>69-72</td><td><i>poison spray</i> (3/day)</td></tr><tr><td>73-76</td><td><i>vicious mockery</i> (3/day)</td></tr><tr><td>77-79</td><td><i>sanctuary</i> (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>80-82</td><td><i>expeditious retreat</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>83-85</td><td><i>hunter's mark</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>86-87</td><td><i>cause fear</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>88-89</td><td><i>thunderwave</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>90-91</td><td><i>cure wounds</i> (1/day)</td></tr><tr><td>92-93</td><td><i>barkskin</i> (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>94-95</td><td><i>spider climb</i> (self only)</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td><i>alter self</i></td></tr><tr><td>97</td><td><i>invisibility</i> (1/day, self only)</td></tr><tr><td>98</td><td><i>dragon's breath</i> (1/day, self only)</td></tr><tr><td>99</td><td><i>fly</i> (1/day, self only)</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>Roll twice more, rerolling further 00s</td></tr></tbody></table>
