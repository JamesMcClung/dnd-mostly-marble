They have stone-gray skin and don't grow any hair. They are nomadic, wandering the mountain peeks of Gabroria, and reclusive. Their tribes are led by one or more <i>Naauao</i>, or Wise Ones. Goliaths have many cultural similarities with stone giants, including a strict social hierarchy (though not as strict as the giants' Ordning), an appreciation for thrown-projectile sports, and a strong <a href="/settings/four-corners/languages.html#goliath">linguistic</a> influence.</div> <div class="p">Goliaths call themselves the <i>Kipakuia</i>, which translates to the Exiled People. Their mythos states that the Kipakuia were traitors to their ancestors and fled a mythical land of paradise called <i>Lani</i>. Some day, they hope a savior will appear to lead them back to that land.</div> <h2 id="giant-ancestry">Giant Ancestry</h2> <div class="p">Some believe that goliaths are descended from giants, and that may be in part true: some rangers have reported magically sensing giants where there were actually goliaths. Scholars argue that goliath cannot be descended from giants because they are not part of the Ordning. However, their name for themselves—the Exiled People—may refer to their exile from the Ordning. Only <a href="/settings/four-corners/people.html#andre-the-bold-hurst">one scholar</a> was ever brave enough and cared enough to interrogate actual giants on the matter, and he never returned from his expedition.</div> <div class="p">For their part, goliaths avoid stone giants and occasionally refer to them as the Tormentors. Giants serve the role of bogeymen in many goliath children's tales.</div> <h2 id="distrust-of-magic">Distrust of Magic</h2> <div class="p">Only the natural magic of the Naauao is tolerated in goliath society, and even that makes most goliath uncomfortable. Goliath believe that channeling arcane or divine magic makes the channeler vulnerable to possession by a powerful evil spirit. This spirit is variously referred to as <i>Inoa'ole</i> (the Nameless One) or <i>Mea Noonoo</i> (the Mind Taker). If such a magic user makes the slightest faux pas in a goliath's home, it may be taken as a sign of possession and end poorly for the mage.</div> &lt;redacted> <h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2> <div class="medium-card"> <h1 id="goliath">Goliath</h1> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Goliaths have the following ability score tendencies.</div> <div class="p"><b>Descended from Giants.</b> Goliaths are incredibly strong and tough, like their distant stone giant kin.

Exceptions exist, but goliaths who do not recognize the authority of superiors are truly rare.</div> </div> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Age.</i></b> Goliaths age slowly, reaching maturity around age 30. Your <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#old-age">old age</a> threshold is 150 years, and your aging rate is 5 years.</div> </div> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write <a href="/settings/four-corners/languages.html#goliath">Goliath</a>.</div> </div> <div class="multi-p"> <div class="p"><b><i>Size.</i></b> Your size is Medium, barely.
