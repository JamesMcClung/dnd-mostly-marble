        <h1 id="goliath">Goliath</h1>
<div class="p">Goliaths are among the tallest and toughest people in the world. They have stone-gray skin and don't grow any hair. They are nomadic, wandering the mountain peeks of Gabroria, and reclusive. Their tribes are led by one or more <i>Naauao</i>, or Wise Ones. Goliaths have many cultural similarities with stone giants, including a strict social hierarchy (though not as strict as the giants' Ordning), an appreciation for thrown-projectile sports, and a strong <a href="../languages.html#goliath">linguistic</a> influence.</div>
<div class="p">Goliaths call themselves the <i>Kipakuia</i>, which translates to the Exiled People. Their mythos states that the Kipakuia were traitors to their ancestors and fled a mythical land of paradise called <i>Lani</i>. Some day, they hope a savior will appear to lead them back to that land.</div>
<h2 id="giant-ancestry">Giant Ancestry</h2>
<div class="p">Some believe that goliaths are descended from giants, and that may be in part true: some rangers have reported magically sensing giants where there were actually goliaths. Scholars argue that goliath cannot be descended from giants because they are not part of the Ordning. However, their name for themselves—the Exiled People—may refer to their exile from the Ordning. Only <a href="../people.html#andre-the-bold-hurst">one scholar</a> was ever brave enough and cared enough to interrogate actual giants on the matter, and he never returned from his expedition.</div>
<div class="p">For their part, goliaths avoid stone giants and occasionally refer to them as the Tormentors. Giants serve the role of bogeymen in many goliath children's tales.</div>
<h2 id="distrust-of-magic">Distrust of Magic</h2>
<div class="p">Only the natural magic of the Naauao is tolerated in goliath society, and even that makes most goliath uncomfortable. Goliath believe that channeling arcane or divine magic makes the channeler vulnerable to possession by a powerful evil spirit. This spirit is variously referred to as <i>Inoa'ole</i> (the Nameless One) or <i>Mea Noonoo</i> (the Mind Taker). If such a magic user makes the slightest faux pas in a goliath's home, it may be taken as a sign of possession and end poorly for the mage.</div>

<div class="medium-card">
    <h1 id="goliath">Goliath</h1>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Like their distant giant kin, Goliaths are strong and tough. Goliath elders are also known to possess great wisdom.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Age.</i></b> Goliaths age slowly, reaching maturity around age 30. Your <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#old-age">old age</a> threshold is 150 years, and your aging rate is 5 years.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Goliath society follows a strict social hierarchy, and many goliaths are lawful neutral as a result. Exceptions exist, but goliaths who do not recognize the authority of superiors are truly rare.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Goliath.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Size.</i></b> Your size is Medium, barely. Goliaths frequently reach heights in excess of 8 feet.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Due to your long legs, your base walking speed is 35 feet.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Blood of Giants.</i></b> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as a Giant to abilities that detect giants.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Powerful Build.</i></b> You count as one size larger than your actual size for the purpose of <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor0" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup0, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup0, anchor0)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup0)">grappling</span>, determining your carrying capacity, and determining the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Mountain Born.</i></b> You have resistance to cold damage. You're also acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Natural Thrower.</i></b> Like stone giants, goliaths can hurl rocks to great effect. You are proficient with thrown improvised weapons.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Stone's Endurance.</i></b> Blows occasionally glance off your stone-like body. When you take damage other than psychic damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by 1d12 plus your Constitution modifier.</div>
    <div class="p">You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</div>
    <div class="p"><b><i>Unflinching.</i></b> If you are concentrating and you take damage, you do not have to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration unless the damage exceeds your level.</div>

    <div class="p card-subheader"><i>Prerequisite: Not immune to the <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#frightened">frightened</a> condition<br>Cost: 2 feat points</i></div>
    <div class="p">Your distrust of magic allows you to partially shield yourself from it. You gain the following benefit(s) and drawback:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>You have advantage on Intelligence saving throws.</li>
        <li>If you are a <a href="/settings/four-corners/races/goliath.html">goliath</a>, your Stone's Endurance trait can reduce psychic damage.</li>
        <li>When you attempt to cast a spell, you must first succeed on a Wisdom check. The DC is equal to 5 + the level of the spell. If you fail, it is as if you never attempted to cast the spell, but you cannot attempt to cast a spell again on this turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="p">Many goliaths have this feat due to their stories of the fearful spirit Inoa'ole, who can possess anyone who opens their mind to magic.</div>
