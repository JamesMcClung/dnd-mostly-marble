        <h1 id="changeling">Changeling</h1>

<ul><li>Found on all 3 continents, in most major communities
</li><li>Can live for up to a century, and don't suffer effects of old age until the very end
</li><li>Strong dislike of changelings in both Ata and Gabroria
<ul><li>In both continents, changelings are rumored to steal human (or orc) infants and replace them with changelings, like mockingbirds
<ul><li>This superstition is probably absent in Verdania due to the scarcity of Elf infants
</li><li>Based on some truth: <i>doppelgangers</i>, not changelings, do do this
</li><li>Changelings reproduce just like any other race, but age does not affect their ability to have children
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>History and homeland of the race is unknown, since changelings rarely pass knowledge across generations
</li><li>Some changelings love adopting new personas and never settle down, while others find a niche and may even reveal themselves to their community. Disproportionately many of them wind up as criminals due to their ability to evade recognition and impersonate others.
</li></ul>
