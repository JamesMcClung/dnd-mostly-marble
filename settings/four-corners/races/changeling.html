            <h1 id="changeling">Changeling</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Found on all 3 continents, in most major communities</li>
                <li>Can live for up to a century, and don't suffer effects of old age until the very end</li>
                <li>
                    Strong dislike of changelings in both Ata and Gabroria
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In both continents, changelings are rumored to steal human (or orc) infants and replace them with changelings, like mockingbirds
                            <ul>
                                <li>This superstition is probably absent in Verdania due to the scarcity of Elf infants</li>
                                <li>Based on some truth: <i>doppelgangers</i>, not changelings, do do this</li>
                                <li>Changelings reproduce just like any other race, but age does not affect their ability to have children</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>History and homeland of the race is unknown, since changelings rarely pass knowledge across generations</li>
                <li>Some changelings love adopting new personas and never settle down, while others find a niche and may even reveal themselves to their community. Disproportionately many of them wind up as criminals due to their ability to evade recognition and impersonate others.</li>
            </ul>
