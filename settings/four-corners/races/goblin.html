        <h1 id="goblin">Goblin</h1>

<div class='p'>Goblins are bitter, vindictive, devious creatures. An empathetic goblin is a genetic failure; they are rare, and unlikely to survive in the backstabbing world of goblin society.</div>

<h2 id="underground-colonies">Underground Colonies</h2>

<div class='p'>Common goblin civilization comprises thousands of small tribes scattered just underground and massive colonies in the larger caverns below. Only two things unite them: hatred for surface dwellers and fear of the more powerful denizens of the caves.</div>

<div class='p'>The extent of goblin infrastructure is short connecting tunnels between natural caverns. Few tunnels actually connect to where they were intended. More often, they dead-end due to lost motivation, going in the wrong direction, or—if so much as a single gemstone is unearthed—the entire mining team self-destructs in a frenzy of murders. Fortunately, goblins always find a use for empty tunnels.</div>

<div class='p'>Thousands of goblins in a small space would make for an unholy amount of filth if not for the wormpits. <i>Gorv</i> (likely a shortened form of the words for "shit worm") worms flourish in designated waste pits and can reach gargantuan sizes if left unchecked. Many fungi also grow in the wormpits. The most important variety, <i>ukugogli</i> (suspiciously reminiscent of the words for "tasty shit mushroom"), is a staple in goblin cuisine. The other staple is fried gorv.</div>

<h2 id="shadowed-citadels">Shadowed Citadels</h2>

<div class='p'>Dark goblins are fewer in number but more organized. They live in some of the deepest tunnels of Gabroria. They show some measure of skill in masonry and carve out proper cities, even if the angles aren't quite aligned. They worship Amnat, a god of darkness and vengeance, in a religion called <a href="../religion.html">Mrakism</a>. Common goblins fear them.</div>

<h2 id="predatory-abominations">Predatory Abominations</h2>

<div class='p'>Rarest of all, ungoblins are solitary hunters, and have no culture of their own. Most ungoblins do not even speak a language. They stalk shallow caves in western Gabroria. Ungoblins are feared by all races for their hunting tactic: they lie in wait in a cave just below the surface with an entrance nearby. When a creature gets close enough, the ungoblin unleashes a psychic attack to either kill or stun the victim. Once its prey is neutralized, the ungoblin emerges from its hiding place and finishes the job.</div>

&lt;redacted>

<h2 id="physical-appearances">Physical Appearances</h2>

<div class='p'>Common goblins are short, bony, greasy things with sickly green skin of any shade. Malnutrition often gives them distended bellies and other deformities.</div>

<div class='p'>Dark goblins are similar in build but with white, slightly translucent skin and huge eyes. They stay partially cloaked in tendrils of shadow whenever possible.</div>

<div class='p'>Ungoblins are twisted even by goblin reckoning. They have empty sockets for eyes, soft and bendable bones, and fingers that are twice as long as they ought to be. Extra fingers, limbs, and even heads afflict one ungoblin in three.</div>

<div class="medium-card">
    <h1 id="goblin">Goblin</h1>
    <div class='p'><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> What goblins lack in size and strength, they make up for with cunning. Goblins tend to have low Strength and Constitution but high Dexterity and Intelligence.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Age.</i></b> Goblins are short-lived creatures. They reach maturity at age 7, old age at 30, and few live past 50.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Whether or not it is their fault, few goblins can be called good. From roving tribe to subterranean empire, goblin societies widely encourage shenanigans, bastardry, and deviousness.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Size.</i></b> Your size is Small.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Despite your small size, your base walking speed is 30 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Nimble Escape.</i></b> You can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of your turns.</div>
    <h2 id="common-goblin">Common Goblin</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Language.</i></b> You can speak one variant of Goblish.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Resilient to Disease.</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against disease.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Fury of the Small.</i></b> When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.</div>

<div class='p'>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. You can use this trait no more than once per turn.</div>
<h2 id="dark-goblin">Dark Goblin</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Language.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Deep Goblish.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Superior Darkvision.</i></b> You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Sunlight Sensitivity.</i></b> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Inured to Horrors.</i></b> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Shadow Camouflage.</i></b> You have advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in dim light or darkness.</div>
<h2 id="ungoblin">Ungoblin</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Aberrant Body.</i></b> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as an Aberration to abilities that detect aberrations.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Eyeless.</i></b> You are blind, as you lack eyes. You have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Bendable Bones.</i></b> Your bones are malleable. You can squeeze through a space as narrow as 2 inches wide.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Long Fingers.</i></b> You have a climb speed of 20 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Touch of Minds.</i></b> You can sense the minds of any creature within 60 feet of you that has an Intelligence score of at least 4, allowing you to effectively see them.</div>

<div class='p'>Additionally, you can communicate telepathically with any creature within 60 feet of you that you can see (by sensing its mind, for instance). You can transmit and receive words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages, allowing communication whether or not you share a common language. You can speak telepathically in this way to only one creature at a time.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Insidious Assault.</i></b> As an action, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this race). On a failed save, it takes 1d10 psychic damage.</div>

<div class='p'>You can cause a creature that fails the saving throw to also be stunned until the end of your next turn. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</div>
