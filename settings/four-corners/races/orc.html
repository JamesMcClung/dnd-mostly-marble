        <h1 id="orc">Orc</h1>
<p>Orcish society is as unforgiving as the land they call home. Clans frequently skirmish with each other over control of scarce resources in the Atan northlands, and blood feuds drive clans to fight for no other reason than mutual hatred. Within most clans, orcs behave completely differently: almost any orc would give up his or her life to protect the clan, and honor has an important place in clan customs.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of honor, orcs do not have honorifics. Even the chief is not treated any differently from other orcs. Many outsiders perceive orcs' frankness and indecorousness as rudeness or insult.</p>
<h2 id="threefold-people">Threefold People</h2>
<p>There are three primary superclans of orcs. The <em>Dej Khov</em> or "Ice" Orcs along the northernmost shores spend half the year on the ice plains hunting for seals. The <em>Qhov Tsua</em> or "Cave" Orcs live underground, either in tunnels dug through permafrost or in the expansive cave networks of the northern mountains. In between are the <em>Ntoo</em> or "Wood" Orcs, who live in the boreal forests.</p>
<p>Each superclan has a king of sorts called a Khan. Every fifth winter, the chiefs of each clan from a given superclan gather at a sacred place known only to chiefs. There, the chiefs determine who is to be Khan. This meeting is called <em>Lub rooj sib tham ntawm Cov Thawj Coj</em> or "Chiefsmoot". If the existing Khan is deemed to have acted dishonorably or against the interests of the superclan, the chiefs may select a new Khan to replace him. In such cases, the previous Khan does not return from Chiefsmoot and is never spoken of again.</p>
<p>Despite having no direct authority, a Khan serves a handful of functions. A Khan belongs to no clan and fighting is prohibited in a Khan's presence, and he can therefore serve as a diplomat between feuding clans. (To orcs it is usually preferable to simply continue the feud.) He also speaks on behalf of the entire superclan when dealing with the other two Khans. Most importantly, only a Khan is permitted to travel to the hidden realm of the Great Orcs to trade offerings for favor and revelations.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-orcs">The Great Orcs</h2>
<p>Outside of the ice, cave, and wood orcs are the great orcs. These hulking brutes are the religious leaders of orckind. They preside from a place called <em>Tsev Fuabtais Loj</em>, which translates literally to Great Castle. The location of Tsev Fuabtais Loj is unknown to all but the Khans, and little is known of the great orcs except what is gleaned of them from old stories about human-orc wars.</p>
<p>It is believed that many fantastical magical items are kept at Tsev Fuabtais Loj. No human treasure hunter has ever found the place (and no orc would try).</p>
&lt;redacted>
<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
<p>All orcs have mottled skin, protruding lower tusks, thick hair, and coarse features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood orcs have marbled skin of dark green and brown.</li>
<li>Cave orcs have dark gray skin and nearly solid black eyes. They are the shortest type of orc by nearly a foot on average.</li>
<li>Ice orcs have pale skin with a blue tint.</li>
<li>Great orcs have splotchy skin of gray and off-white. They are the tallest and bulkiest by far, standing a head taller than most other orcs without exception. They are also prone to physical deformities due to a history of inbreeding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="orcs-and-humans">Orcs and Humans</h2>
<p>Humans largely believe orcs are monsters and are treated as such. This is due to a number of reasons, including their capacity for violence, apparent lack of manners, and scary appearance.</p>
<p>In a way, orcs agree with the humans. Orcs are far more suspicious and hateful of enemy clans than of humans. Most orcs are just wary of humans.</p>
