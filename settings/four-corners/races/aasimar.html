<p>Aasimar can be born to any race. Barring magic (an aasimar's celestial nature can be detected even while it is still in the womb), there is no sure way to distiniguish an aasimar child from a normal child, though all aasimar are exceptionially beautiful and hale. Most aasimar first manifest their powers during adolescence.</p>

<h2 id="portentous-birth">Portentous Birth</h2>
<p>An aasimar's birth is often marked by a good or ill omen, depending on whether the aasimar is theurgic or malefic. See the Aasimar Omens table for examples of omens. It is said that the magnitude of the omen is commensurate to the impact of the aasimar's life on the world.</p>

<h2 id="innate-alignment">Innate Alignment</h2>
<p>Unlike other races, aasimar never deviate from their expected alignment: good for theurgic, or evil for malefic. Even <a href="tiefling.html">tieflings</a> can fight their impulses towards chaos or orderliness, but for aasimar, there is nothing to fight. </p>

<div class="race-card">
    <h3 id="aasimar">Aasimar</h3>
    <p><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Aasimar enjoy the attributes of their parents, but supernaturally enhanced. Their beauty is particularly enhanced, which often comes with a higher Charisma.</p>
<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Aasimar are blessed with a longer lifespan than that of their parents, living about 50% longer than normal and without any illnesses of old age.</p>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Theurgic aasimar are invariably kind and beneficent, while malefic aasimar are apathetic and cruel. Upbringing might explain some variation in how good or evil an aasimar is, but there are no known exceptions to the overall rule.</p>
<p><b><i>Inherited Traits.</i></b> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</p>
<p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Your enhanced vision gives you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
<p><b><i>Celestial Soul.</i></b> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as a Celestial to abilities that detect celestials.</p>
<p><b><i>Divine Resistance.</i></b> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</p>
    <h4 id="theurgic-aasimar">Theurgic Aasimar</h4>
<p><b><i>Theurgic Spells.</i></b> You know the <i>light</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you learn the <i>cure wounds</i> spell. When you reach 5th level, you learn the <i>calm emotions</i> spell. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</p>
<p><b><i>Theurgic Presence.</i></b> Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and a luminous halo to surround you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you end it as a bonus action, or until you are incapacitated. You gain the following benefits while transformed:</p>
<ul><li>You shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
</li><li>When a creature regains hit points in the bright light, you sense it and can cause the creature to heal additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
</li><li>You and your good-aligned allies in the bright light have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.
</li></ul>

<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="malefic-aasimar">Malefic Aasimar</h4>
<p><b><i>Malefic Spells.</i></b> You know the <i>toll the dead</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you learn the <i>cause fear</i> spell. When you reach 5th level, you learn the <i>darkness</i> spell. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</p>
<p><b><i>Malefic Presence.</i></b> Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and dreadful shadows to dance around you. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute, until you end it as a bonus action, or until you are incapacitated. You gain the following benefits while transformed:</p>
<ul><li>Bright light within 10 feet of you turns to dim light. Light that was already dim within 5 feet of you turns to darkness instead.
</li><li>When a creature regains hit points in the dim light or darkness, you sense it and can cause the creature to heal fewer hit points equal to your proficiency bonus (minimum 0).
</li><li>You and your evil-aligned allies in the dim light or darkness have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.
</li></ul>

<p>You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
