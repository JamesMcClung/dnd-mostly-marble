<p>Aasimar can be born to any race. Barring magic (an aasimar's celestial nature can be detected even while it is still in the womb), there is no sure way to distiniguish an aasimar child from a normal child, though all aasimar are exceptionially beautiful and hale. Most aasimar first manifest their powers during adolescence.</p>
<h2 id="portentous-birth">Portentous Birth</h2>
<p>An aasimar's birth is often marked by a good or ill omen, depending on whether the aasimar is theurgic or malefic. See the Aasimar Omens table for examples of omens. It is said that the magnitude of the omen is commensurate to the impact of the aasimar's life on the world.</p>

<h2 id="innate-alignment">Innate Alignment</h2>
<p>Unlike other races, aasimar never deviate from their expected alignment: good for theurgic, or evil for malefic. Even <a href="tieflings.html">tieflings</a> can fight their impulses towards chaos or orderliness, but for aasimar, there is nothing to fight.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Aasimar are blessed with a longer lifespan than that of their parents, living about 50% longer than normal and without any illnesses of old age.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Theurgic aasimar are invariably kind and beneficent, while malefic aasimar are apathetic and cruel. Upbringing might explain some variation in how good or evil an aasimar is, but there are no known exceptions to the overall rule.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Inherited Traits.</em></strong> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your enhanced vision gives you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
