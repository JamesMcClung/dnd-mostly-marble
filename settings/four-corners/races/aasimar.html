<div class='p'>Aasimar can be born to any race. Barring magic (an aasimar's celestial nature can be detected even while it is still in the womb), there is no sure way to distiniguish an aasimar child from a normal child, though all aasimar are exceptionially beautiful and hale. Most aasimar first manifest their powers during adolescence.</div>

<h2 id="portentous-birth">Portentous Birth</h2>
<div class='p'>An aasimar's birth is often marked by a good or ill omen, depending on whether the aasimar is theurgic or malefic. See the Aasimar Omens table for examples of omens. It is said that the magnitude of the omen is commensurate to the impact of the aasimar's life on the world.</div>

<h2 id="innate-alignment">Innate Alignment</h2>
<div class='p'>Unlike other races, aasimar never deviate from their expected alignment: good for theurgic, or evil for malefic. Even <a href="tiefling.html">tieflings</a> can fight their impulses towards chaos or orderliness, but for aasimar, there is nothing to fight. </div>

<h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2>

<div class="medium-card">
    <h1 id="aasimar">Aasimar</h1>
    <div class='p'><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Aasimar enjoy the attributes of their parents, but supernaturally enhanced. Their beauty is particularly enhanced, which often comes with a higher Charisma.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Age.</i></b> Aasimar are blessed with a longer lifespan than that of their parents, living about 50% longer than normal and without suffering the effects of <a href="/settings/four-corners/rules.html#old-age">old age</a>.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Theurgic aasimar are invariably kind and beneficent, while malefic aasimar are apathetic and cruel. Upbringing might explain some variation in how good or evil an aasimar is, but there are no known exceptions to the overall rule.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Inherited Traits.</i></b> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> Your enhanced vision gives you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Celestial Soul.</i></b> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as a Celestial to abilities that detect celestials.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Divine Resistance.</i></b> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.</div>
    <h2 id="theurgic-aasimar">Theurgic Aasimar</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Theurgic Spells.</i></b> You know the <i>light</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you learn the <i>cure wounds</i> spell. When you reach 5th level, you learn the <i>calm emotions</i> spell. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Theurgic Presence.</i></b> Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and a luminous halo to surround you. You create an aura out to a range of 15 feet with the following effects:</div>
<ul><li>You shed bright light within the aura, and dim light for an additional 15 feet outside the aura.
</li><li>When you or a non-evil ally regains hit points while in the aura and not in darkness, it regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can receive this extra healing no more than once per turn.
</li><li>You and your good-aligned allies have advantage on Wisdom saving throws while in the aura and not in darkness.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>Your aura lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end it on your turn as a bonus action.</div>

<div class='p'>You can activate your aura a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</div>
<h2 id="malefic-aasimar">Malefic Aasimar</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Malefic Spells.</i></b> You know the <i>toll the dead</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you learn the <i>cause fear</i> spell. When you reach 5th level, you learn the <i>darkness</i> spell. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Malefic Presence.</i></b> Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and dreadful shadows to dance around you. You create an aura out to a range of 15 feet with the following effects:</div>
<ul><li>Bright light within the aura turns to dim light.
</li><li>When a creature other than you takes damage while in the aura and not in bright light, it takes additional necrotic damage equal to half your proficiency bonus. A creature can take this damage no more than once per turn.
</li><li>You and your evil-aligned allies have advantage on Wisdom saving throws while in the aura and not in bright light.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>Your aura lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end it on your turn as a bonus action.</div>

<div class="small-card">
    <h1 id="searing-presence">Searing Presence</h1>
    <div class="p card-subheader"><em>Prerequisite: Aasimar, 3rd level<br>Cost: 8 feat points</em></div>
    <div class='p'>When you activate your Theurgic or Malefic Presence, you can choose to augment it with the following additional effects:</div>
<ul><li>Spectral wings grow from your back, granting you a flying speed of 40 feet. These wings are made of brilliant light (theurgic) or murky darkness (malefic). You choose their shape when you select this feat.
</li><li>Once on each of your turns, you can deal extra damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus, and is radiant (theurgic) or necrotic (malefic).
</li><li>You take damage at the start of each of your turns. The damage equals the number of times you have already used this feature to augment your Presence since you last completed a long rest, and its type is radiant (theurgic) or necrotic (malefic). The damage bypasses resistance.
