<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Humans reach adulthood at around 20 and old age at 70 years. Few live longer than a century.</p>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Humans generally share an alignment with their peers, which in turn varies across cultures and generations. A human can easily take on any alignment.</p>

<p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write the language of your upbringing and one other language of your choice.</p>
    <h4 id="common-human">Common Human</h4>
<p><b><i>Personal Calling.</i></b> Humans are known for dedicating themselves to a skill or trade and perfecting it. You gain expertise in one skill or tool of your choice.</p>
<p><b><i>Perfected Skill.</i></b> Before making a check to which the expertise granted by your Personal Calling applies, you can opt to not roll the d20. If you do, treat the check as if you had rolled a 15. If the roll would have been made with advantage or disadvantage, instead treat the check as if you had rolled a 20 or 10, respectively.</p>

<p><b><i>Adaptable Talent.</i></b> Pick an ability score for each of the following categories: saving throws, attack rolls, and ability checks.
