  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Dragonborn are often very strong and zealous, corresponding to high Strength and Charisma. More primal or reserved dragonborn may have sharper senses, corresponding to Wisdom.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dragonbornlings spend 6 months in an egg before hatching. Youths reach maturity at age 12 when they are 4 to 5 feet tall, but continue to grow their entire lives. Their wings typically develop around age 25. Old age begins at 70 years. Dragonborn rarely live past 80, since by that age, their still-growing size makes them increasingly vulnerable to heart failure.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> On Dragon Island, dragonborn of both creeds follow the examples set by their draconic forefathers. Metallic dragonborn on the island are intensely righteous and even callous, but never malicious. On the other hand, the chromatic dragonborn are egotistical, greedy, and ruled by strength.<br>Away from Dragon Island, these ideological trends are significantly less pronounced. Whatever an individual dragonborn's outlook, it is almost surely in the extreme; the only alignment that is rare in dragonborn is true neutrality.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Dragonborn are generally monolingual on Dragon Island, and most dragonborn who leave the island still retain their native tongue.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Adult dragonborn usually reach 6 feet tall within 20 years, after which their growth starts to slow. Even so, elder dragonborn often exceed 8 feet in height. Dragonborn also grow heavier throughout their life, with adults ranging from 200 to 400 pounds on average as they age.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Inheriting keen eyes from dragons, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Draconic Ancestry.</em></strong> Your draconic heritage manifests in several ways based on your draconic hue. Pick one dragon type from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits.</p> <h5 id="draconic-ancestry">Draconic Ancestry</h5> <table> <thead><tr><th>Dragon Type</th><th>Damage Type</th><th>Breath Weapon</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Black</td><td>Acid</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>Lightning</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>Poison</td><td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>Fire</td><td>15 ft. cone (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>Cold</td><td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Copper</td><td>Acid</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Gold</td><td>Fire</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td> <tr><td>Iron</td><td>Lightning</td><td>15 ft. cone (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Lead</td><td>Poison</td><td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Silver</td><td>Cold</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Con. save)</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p><strong><em>Breath Weapon.</em></strong> You can accumulate elemental energy within yourself and unleash it with your breath. You have a number of breath weapon dice equal to 2 + half your level, which are d6s. As a bonus action, you can roll and expend any number of these dice and force each creature in your breath weapon area to make a saving throw. The shape, saving throw, and damage type are determined by your Draconic Ancestry. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice). A creature takes damage equal the number rolled on the expended dice on a failed save, or half as much on a success.<br>You regain all expended breath weapon dice at the end of a short or long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damage Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry.</p>
