<p>Born of elemental magma, Salamanders awoke in volcanic pits of Gabroria about a century ago and have remained there since. <a href="dwarf.html">Cinder dwarf</a> sulfur miners discovered the first primitive Salamander "town" in 105 SK. Four more were found since then across a total of three volcanos, with the last town being found in 154 SK.</p>
<p>Cinder dwarves don't like to acknowledge initial failed attempts at slavery.</p>
<p>The cinder dwarves now employ Salamanders in exchange for information and material goods. With the dwarves' guidance, Salamanders have constructed proper citadels in their original pits. Some now travel the world.</p>
<h2 id="young-race-young-people">Young Race, Young People</h2>
<p>Without anything resembling traditions or a history, Salamander culture is virtually nonexistant. Most Salamanders live their lives in a state of perpetual shock at being alive at all. This bewilderment wears off very slowly over time; only the oldest Salamanders have much personality at all.</p>
<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>
<p>Salamanders resemble a cross between a newt and a turtle, if that cross were made of lava. Dark volcanic rock covers a Salamander's back, including down to the tip of their tail and to the top of their head. Islands of rock jut out from other parts of the body, especially near joints. The limbs, head, and tail are otherwise smooth, glowing lava.</p>

  <h3 id="salamander">Salamander</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Young Salamanders are all but mindless. Intelligence and Wisdom increase with age much faster than Charisma, but still slowly. Physically, Salamanders are moderately strong and hardy, but also sluggish and not very nimble.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> If Salamanders do age, none have lived long enough to find out. They are generally considered mature at age 50 when their personality is mostly figured out, but there are no physical changes whatsoever.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Young Salamanders are neutral as can be. As their personality develops, their alignment may crystallize to anything, but usually ends up more lawful and good than chaotic or evil.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write the Cinder Dwarf dialect of Dwarvish.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium or Small. Choose when you select this race.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed depends on the ambient temperature. It is 20 feet below 0°F, 30 feet above 100°F, and 25 feet in between.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> Your creature type is Elemental, but you also register as a Humanoid to abilities that detect humanoids.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Volcanic Immunities.</em></strong> You are immune to fire and poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Water Susceptability.</em></strong> When you are doused in at least 5 gallons of water, you take 1 cold damage and some of the water boils away. You can take damage in this way only once per round.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Magmatic Glow.</em></strong> You shed bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Superheated Body.</em></strong> When a creature comes into direct contact with your body, it takes 1d4 fire damage. A creature can take this damage no more than once per round. Additionally, you ignite any flammable object you touch for more than 6 seconds.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Elemental Nature.</em></strong> You have immunity to disease, and you don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.</p>
