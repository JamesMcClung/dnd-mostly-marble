        <h1 id="salamander">Salamander</h1>

<p>Born of elemental magma, Salamanders awoke in volcanic pits of Gabroria about a century ago and have remained there since. <a href="dwarf.html">Cinder dwarf</a> sulfur miners discovered the first primitive Salamander "town" in 105 SK. Four more were found since then across a total of three volcanos, with the last town being found in 154 SK.</p>

<p>The cinder dwarves now employ Salamanders in exchange for information and material goods. With the dwarves' guidance, Salamanders have constructed proper citadels in their original pits. Some now travel the world.</p>

<h2 id="young-race-young-people">Young Race, Young People</h2>

<p>Without anything resembling traditions or a history, Salamander culture is virtually nonexistant. Most Salamanders live their lives in a state of perpetual shock at being alive at all. This bewilderment wears off very slowly over time; only the oldest Salamanders have much personality at all.</p>

<h2 id="physical-appearance">Physical Appearance</h2>

<p>Salamanders resemble a cross between a newt and a turtle, if that cross were made of lava. Dark volcanic rock covers a Salamander's back, including down to the tip of their tail and to the top of their head. Islands of rock jut out from other parts of the body, especially near joints. The limbs, head, and tail are otherwise smooth, glowing lava.</p>

    <h3 id="salamander">Salamander</h3>
    <p><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Young Salamanders are all but mindless. Intelligence and Wisdom increase with age much faster than Charisma, but still slowly. Physically, Salamanders are moderately strong and hardy, but also sluggish and not very nimble.</p>

<script src='/js/sortTable.js'></script>
<script src='/js/drag.js'></script>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Young Salamanders are neutral as can be. As their personality develops, their alignment may crystallize to anything, but usually ends up more lawful and good than chaotic or evil.</p>
