        <h1 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h1>
<p>Dwarves are native to the mountains of Gabroria. They are universally short and stocky, ranging from 4-5 feet tall but easily weighing 150-230 pounds. Dwarfmen almost always sport impressive beards.</p>
<p>There are a handful of distinct Dwarvish nations. Each nation specializes in processing the resources present in or around their capital.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron Dwarves: largest kingdom with ample iron
<ul>
<li>started small but quickly took land from Bronze Dwarves</li>
<li>elite subcategory: Steel Dwarves
<ul>
<li>responsible for binding Shaitan in Helvete after stealing work from Adamant Dwarves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>entered Æði (Behemoth) Pact with Granite Dwarves: Granite Dwarves help bolster Helvete against Behemoth's attacks in exchange for iron, steel, and freedom to study Shaitan. Pact rendered moot while Behemoth is bound.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gold Dwarves: small group of cities that is rarely independent
<ul>
<li>perpetual subjects of other nations, currently Iron Kingdom</li>
<li>terrible quality of life for working class, which most Gold Dwarves are</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>East &#x26; West Silver Dwarves: actually two kingdoms separated by the Fjordbukta
<ul>
<li>the east kingdom came first and colonized the west side, which later declared independence</li>
<li>only dwarves to have a navy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bronze Dwarves: medium-sized kingdom with lots of copper
<ul>
<li>once the largest kingdom, but lost territory to Iron Dwarves</li>
<li>lots of trade with Gnomes and Dwarves, especially Pewter Dwarves</li>
<li>most inventive Dwarves due to utility of copper and cultural exchange with Gnomes</li>
<li>starting to use brass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pewter Dwarves: smallish kingdom with tin
<ul>
<li>historically home of the best small-scale artisans</li>
<li>increasing in power due to trade with Gnomes and other Dwarves as more uses of tin are found (e.g. canning)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adamant Dwarves: single (now deserted) city that was the only source of adamant
<ul>
<li>needed very high temperatures to process raw adamant, forming a bottleneck to production</li>
<li>feared invasion by Iron Dwarves and were desparate for an advantage</li>
<li>attempted to bind Shaitan in their city to increase adamant smelting, but failed and were destroyed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Granite Dwarves: large kingdom with uniquely durable granite
<ul>
<li>only dwarves to build bulk of cities above ground</li>
<li>also known for abundance of certain gem-quality minerals
<ul>
<li>in order of increasing scarcity/value: quartz (rutile, rose, &#x26; plain), fluorite, tourmaline (schorl &#x26; watermelon), zircon, moonstone, topaz, beryl (emerald &#x26; aquamarine), titanite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>master masons: best architecture by far, including aqueducts carrying water to power public baths &#x26; sewer system</li>
<li>most peaceful of all dwarves due to relative lack of weapons-grade metals, but defenses have never been breached</li>
<li>largest population of wizards</li>
<li>used to get iron and steel from Iron Dwarves through Æði Pact before Behemoths's binding; now short on iron</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Based on Icelandic, with names from Old Norse.</p>
<ul>
<li>runes that are easy to carve</li>
<li>runes can overlap for compactness and speed; these are called "bindrunes" (unrelated to the magical process)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>Dwarves have a first name, a clan name, and rarely an epithet.</p>
