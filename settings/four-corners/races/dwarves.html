        <h1 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h1>
<p>Dwarves are native to the mountains of Gabroria. They are universally short and stocky, ranging from 4-5 feet tall but easily weighing 150-230 pounds. Dwarfmen almost always sport impressive beards.</p>
<p>There are a handful of distinct Dwarvish nations. Each nation specializes in processing the resources present in or around their capital.</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron Dwarves: largest kingdom with ample iron
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Mountain</li>
<li>started small but quickly took land from Bronze Dwarves</li>
<li>elite subcategory: Steel Dwarves
<ul>
<li>responsible for binding Shaitan in Helvete after stealing work from Adamant Dwarves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>entered Æði (Behemoth) Pact with Granite Dwarves: Granite Dwarves help bolster Helvete against Behemoth's attacks in exchange for iron, steel, and freedom to study Shaitan. Pact rendered moot while Behemoth is bound.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gold Dwarves: small group of cities that is rarely independent
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Deep</li>
<li>perpetual subjects of other nations, currently Iron Kingdom</li>
<li>terrible quality of life for working class, which most Gold Dwarves are</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>East &#x26; West Silver Dwarves: actually two kingdoms separated by the Fjordbukta
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Fjord</li>
<li>the east kingdom came first and colonized the west side, which later declared independence</li>
<li>only dwarves to have a navy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bronze Dwarves: medium-sized kingdom with lots of copper
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Mountain</li>
<li>once the largest kingdom, but lost territory to Iron Dwarves</li>
<li>lots of trade with Gnomes and Dwarves, especially Pewter Dwarves</li>
<li>most inventive Dwarves due to utility of copper and cultural exchange with Gnomes</li>
<li>starting to use brass</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pewter Dwarves: smallish kingdom with tin
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Mountain</li>
<li>historically home of the best small-scale artisans</li>
<li>increasing in power due to trade with Gnomes and other Dwarves as more uses of tin are found (e.g. canning)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adamant Dwarves: single (now deserted) volcanic city that was the only source of adamant
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Cinder</li>
<li>needed very high temperatures to process raw adamant, forming a bottleneck to production</li>
<li>feared invasion by Iron Dwarves and were desparate for an advantage</li>
<li>attempted to bind Shaitan in their city to increase adamant smelting, but failed and were destroyed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Granite Dwarves: large kingdom with uniquely durable granite
<ul>
<li>primary subrace: Hill</li>
<li>only dwarves to build bulk of cities above ground</li>
<li>also known for abundance of certain gem-quality minerals
<ul>
<li>in order of increasing scarcity/value: quartz (rutile, rose, &#x26; plain), fluorite, tourmaline (schorl &#x26; watermelon), zircon, moonstone, topaz, beryl (emerald &#x26; aquamarine), titanite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>master masons: best architecture by far, including aqueducts carrying water to power public baths &#x26; sewer system</li>
<li>most peaceful of all dwarves due to relative lack of weapons-grade metals, but defenses have never been breached</li>
<li>largest population of wizards</li>
<li>used to get iron and steel from Iron Dwarves through Æði Pact before Behemoths's binding; now short on iron</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Based on Icelandic, with names from Old Norse.</p>
<ul>
<li>runes that are easy to carve</li>
<li>runes can overlap for compactness and speed; these are called "bindrunes" (unrelated to the magical process)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>Dwarves have a first name, a clan name, and rarely an epithet.</p>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Ability.</em></strong> Dwarves are exceptionally hardy by nature, and feats of strength, endurance, and courage are greatly admired in most Dwarvish cultures. As such, Dwarves have a significantly higher Strength and Constitution on average, and individual dwarves may possess high Wisdom or Charisma.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Due to their impressive fortitudes, dwarves rarely get sick at any age. It is common for Dwarves to live for over 150 years in perfect health. However, the frailty of old age sets in at around 200 years, and few Dwarves live longer than 250 years.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Dwarvish cultures generally hold strongly to their laws and traditions, which are literally set in stone in most communities. Dwarves tend strongly towards lawful.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> The Dwarvish language hasn't changed much over time compared to other languages. This is largely due to the Dwarves' long lifespans and opposition to social change. Dwarvish serves as the common language of Gabroria, although there are noticeable differences in dialect between distant regions.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Despite averaging 4 feet tall, Dwarves are truly big-boned and often weigh over 200 pounds.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Descended from those accustomed to working in poorly lit tunnels, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Dwarven Fortitude.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance against poison damage. Furthermore, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Unencumberable.</em></strong> Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor, nor by wielding a <a href=/settings/four-corners/items.html#tower-shield>tower shield</a>. Furthermore, you have advantage on Athletics checks against being shoved.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Choose Cinder, Deep, Fjord, Hill, or Mountain Dwarf as your subrace. 
  <h4 id="fjord-dwarf">Fjord Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Ice Diver.</em></strong> Naturally more buoyant than other dwarves and adapted to freezing water, you have resistance against cold damage and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
<h4 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Ore Taster.</em></strong> As an action, you can taste a rock or alloy to identify its composition. You learn what minerals or metals are present, and in what quantity.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Crag Climber.</em></strong> Your tough nails and strong hands allow you to climb stone with ease. You have advantage on Athletics checks made to climb stone surfaces. You also have resistance against fall damage.</p>
<h4 id="hill-dwarf">Hill Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em></strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Unbreakable Bones.</em></strong> Bludgeoning damage you take is reduced by 1. This reduction is applied after any resistances and vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dwarf">Deep Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Cave Senses.</em></strong> Your ancestors rarely left the safety of their cavern homes. Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet instead of 60 feet. You also have blindsight 10 feet and always know how the floor you stand on is sloped.</p>
<h4 id="cinder-dwarf">Cinder Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Volcano Dweller.</em></strong> As a descendant of dwarves who lived on the slopes of active volcanoes, you have resistance against fire damage and are immune to low doses of volcanic gas.</p>
