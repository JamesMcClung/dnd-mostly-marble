        <h1 id="elves">Elves</h1>
<p>Elves are native to the northern slopes of Verdania.</p>
<ul>
<li>They all have long pointy ears, lean builds, and no body hair. Older elves may have silver hair.
<ul>
<li>Wood elves have copper skin, yellow or green eyes, and brown or orange hair.</li>
<li>High elves have tan skin, green or blue eyes, and orange or golden hair.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both of the largest subgroups, wood elves and high elves, tend to live in isolated communities.</li>
<li>Verdania is extremely poor in metals, so elves are generally inexperienced with metalwork. Instead, high elves make use of certain gemstones in the volcano. Peridot, spinel, and garnet are abundant, while pockets of quartz are scarce but rich. There is even well-hidden vein of kimberlite, named after the city built upon it.</li>
<li>Elves are unaging, and it is rare for one to die of violence or disease due to their wariness and medicinal expertise. This has significantly impacted Elvish culture. For instance, elves hold murder to be the worst crime, and children are uncommon. Every elf knows every other elf in his village or city, and it is common to know most elves in neighboring settlements as well. Most elves are masters of several disciplines, and those who have committed to one discipline are the most skilled in the world. Older elves spend more of their time meditating or practicing art.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wood-elves">Wood Elves</h3>
<p>Drawn to druidic magic, wood elves meld their homes and villages into the large sylvan trees near the coast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent hunters and gatherers, supplemented by magically-grown berries and wild vegetables.</li>
<li>Wood elves have no tamed animals, including horses. Instead, a wood elf that needs to move fast seeks out a wild giant elk to take them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-elves">High Elves</h3>
<p>High elves use their affinity for the arcane arts to construct hidden towers and citadels in the mountain ridges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since they keep the locations of their cities secret, high elf individuals from different cities meet in predetermined places in the wild to trade. This trading is facilitated by the <em>sending</em> spell.</li>
<li>High elves subsist entirely on magically-accelerated agriculture within their cities. They occasionally hunt dangerous beasts for glory, but never for food.</li>
<li>Some high elves have tamed griffons and use them for travel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sea-elves">Sea Elves</h2>
<p>The sea elves trace their ancestry to proto-Elven nobility. Long ago, a great Elf king</p>
<h2 id="settlements">Settlements</h2>
<p>Elves do not have kingdoms or even city-states. Each settlement, be it village or city, is fully autonomous and self-sufficient. Below is a list of these settlements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suffix -arys denotes a citadel, and -or or -oth denotes a village.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>Elvish vocabulary is loosely based on real-world Latin with some Polynesian influence.</p>
<ul>
<li>The modern Elvish alphabet is phonetic and based on Human script. Elves no longer use the Elder Elvish script in scientific work due to the influence of prolific Human mages. The old script is still used by Elvish artists, since the symbols are unique up to homeomorphisms, allowing for extreme calligraphic freedom.</li>
<li>Elves do not use the letters 'k' or 'x'</li>
<li>'c' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_velar_plosive">k</a>] as in "cat"</li>
<li>'y' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a>] as in "pit"</li>
<li>'i' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel">i</a>] as in "free"</li>
<li>'ç' and 's' are always pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative">s</a>] as in "miss". '-s' is used at the end of a syllable, 'ç-' at the start.</li>
<li>'e' is either pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e̞</a>​] as in "let" or is a schwa [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a>]</li>
<li>'a' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_central_unrounded_vowel">ä</a>] as in "ah"</li>
<li>'o' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel">ɑ</a>] as in "hot"</li>
<li>No word can end in '-r'; such words are appended with a vowel, usually '-i'</li>
</ul>
