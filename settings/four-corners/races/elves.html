        <h1 id="elves">Elves</h1>
<p>Elves are native to the northern slopes of Verdania. They have long pointy ears and lean builds as a rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High elves: slightly taller, tan/copper skin, green-blue-white eyes, brown-gold hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood elves: slightly shorter, light skin, green-yellow-brown eyes, brown-orange-red hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hair turns silver in old age (70+ years)</p>
<ul>
<li>Only mortal elves and elves that were old before the Blessing have silver hair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of the largest subgroups, wood elves and high elves, tend to live in isolated communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verdania is extremely poor in metals, so elves are generally inexperienced with metalwork. Instead, high elves make use of certain gemstones in the volcano. Peridot, spinel, and garnet are abundant, while pockets of quartz are scarce but rich. There is even well-hidden vein of kimberlite, named after the city built upon it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elves are unaging, and it is rare for one to die of violence or disease due to their wariness and medicinal expertise. This has significantly impacted Elvish culture. For instance, elves hold murder to be the worst crime, and children are uncommon. Every elf knows every other elf in his village or city, and it is common to know most elves in neighboring settlements as well. Most elves are masters of several disciplines, but those who have committed to one discipline are among the best in the world at it. Older elves spend more of their time meditating or practicing art.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="blessed-elves">Blessed Elves</h2>
<h3 id="wood-elves-omavir">Wood Elves (Omavir)</h3>
<p>Drawn to druidic magic, wood elves meld their homes and villages into the large redwood-like trees near the coast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent hunters and gatherers, supplemented by magically-grown berries and wild vegetables.</li>
<li>Wood elves have no tamed animals, including horses. Instead, a wood elf that needs to move fast seeks out a wild giant elk to take them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-elves-nauvir">High Elves (Nauvir)</h3>
<p>High elves use their affinity for the arcane arts to construct hidden towers and citadels in the mountain ridges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since they keep the locations of their cities secret, high elf individuals from different cities meet in predetermined places in the wild to trade. This trading is facilitated by the <em>sending</em> spell.</li>
<li>High elves subsist entirely on magically-accelerated agriculture within their cities. They occasionally hunt dangerous beasts for glory, but never for food.</li>
<li>Some high elves have tamed griffons and use them for travel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="settlements">Settlements</h3>
<p>Blessed Elves do not have kingdoms or even city-states. Each settlement, be it village or city, is fully autonomous and self-sufficient. Below is a list of these settlements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suffix -arys denotes a citadel, and -or or -oth denotes a village.</li>

<h2 id="mortal-elves">Mortal Elves</h2>
<p>Mortal Elves were separated from their cousins before the Blessing, and never received the gift of immortality.</p>
<h3 id="sea-elves-maredrin">Sea Elves (Maredrin)</h3>
<p>Jungle and Sea Elves trace their ancestry to proto-Elven nobility. According to legend, Shaitan attempted to destroy a prosperous Elven kingdom by expelling so much lava from Verdoa that the land sunk into the sea. Their ruler King Mo'ire, attempting to save everyone, <em>wished</em> for his people to be saved. Only his house was affected, becoming the first Sea Elves. The rest perished, and the ruins of the city lie at the bottom of the Verdan Gulf buried under hundreds of feet of cooled lava.</p>
<p>Sea Elves, or <em>Maredrin</em> in their language, have generally remained in the Verdan Gulf, occasionally venturing out to trade with Triton. Maredrin despise Sahuagin and patrol the gulf to keep them—and other marine threats—out. They worship their ancestors, especially the ancient king who saved them. The Maredrin tend to be envious of the Blessing and are especially bitter about the relative safety that the Blessed Elves enjoy, which they claim is thanks to their efforts.</p>
<h3 id="jungle-elves-maledrin">Jungle Elves (Maledrin)</h3>
<p>In the early days of the Maredrin, one faction was exiled and forced to live on land. These became the Jungle Elves, or <em>Maledrin</em>, who inhabit the mangrove swamps and tropical jungles of Verdania. Their crime was worshipping the kraken they named Lolugo. The kraken was slain long ago by a coalition of Triton and Maredrin, but the Maledrin continue to worship it as their true god.</p>
<p>The Maledrin believe that Lolugo can be brought back by blood sacrifices and aberrant magic. They worship aberrations as lesser gods. &lt;redacted> In combat, the Maledrin take captives in order to ritually sacrifice them later. They occasionally ambush Maredrin patrols, but they are especially fond of hunting Merfolk. A Maledrin captain who fails to take enough captives must sacrifice members of his own family as punishment.</p>
<h3 id="fey-elves-eladrin">Fey Elves (Eladrin)</h3>
<p>15,000 years ago, the Eladrin were a group of proto-Elves who were taken in by a new god, Pahi. According to legend his prophet, a nymph called Uhane, convinced them to sacrifice their souls to help create an entirely new world for them to rule. &lt;redacted> This parallel reality, initially only a mirroring a small portion of Verdania, gradually grew to become the Feywild. The Eladrin no longer rule the Feywild alone, as it simply too big now and more creatures inhabit it.</p>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<p><em>Main page: <a href="../languages.html#elvish">Languages</a></em></p>
<p>Three to five languages are spoken by Elves. Blessed Elves speak <a href="../languages.html#elvish">(Old) Elvish</a>, from which <a href="../languages.html/marese">Marese</a> and <a href="../languages.html#high-sylvan">High Sylvan</a> are derived. Marese is the native language of Sea Elves, and the <a href="../languages.html#malese">Malese</a> dialect (influenced by other worshippers of Lolugo, such as Merrow and Kuo-Toa) is spoken by the Maladrin. High Sylvan is the language of Fey nobility, which comprises mostly Eladrin. <a href="../languages.html#sylvan">Sylvan</a> is its vulgarization, spoken by all Fey creatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elvish vocabulary is based on Latin and occasionally modified to resemble Hawai'ian.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modern Elvish alphabet is phonetic and based on Human script. Elves no longer use the Old Elvish script in academic work due to the influence of prolific Human mages. The old script is still used by Elvish artists, since the symbols are unique up to homeomorphisms, allowing for extreme calligraphic freedom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elves do not use the letters 'k' or 'x'</li>
<li>'c' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_velar_plosive">k</a>]as in "cat"</li>
<li>'y' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a>] as in "pit"</li>
<li>'i' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel">i</a>] as in "free"</li>
<li>'ç' and 's' are always pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative">s</a>] as in "miss". '-s' is used at the end of a syllable, 'ç-' at the start.</li>
<li>'e' is either pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e̞</a>​] as in "let" or is a schwa [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a>]</li>
<li>'a' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_central_unrounded_vowel">ä</a>] as in "are"</li>
<li>'o' is pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel">ɑ</a>] as in "hot"</li>
<li>No word can end in '-r'; such words are appended by a vowel, usually '-i'</li>
</ul>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="elf">Elf</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Like all Elves, Blessed Elves are naturally graceful and have keen senses. Due to their age, they are often knowledgeable as well. Blessed Elves have above-average Dexterity, as well as Intelligence and/or Wisdom.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Thanks to an ancient boon from their god, the Blessed Elves do not grow old. The only Blessed Elves who are visibly aged are the Elders, who were already old when they received the Blessing 12,000 years ago. All Elves reach physical maturity at about the same rate as humans, although a Blessed Elf is considered young until they are at least a century old. Blessed Elves are extremely cautious in battle so as not to die, and children are rare as the birthrate has steadily dropped since the Blessing. Most Blessed Elves are over 5,000 years old, although wars with hobgoblins took heavy tolls from some of the older generations.</p><p>The Mortal Elves have comparable lives to Humans, growing old at 70 and rarely living past 100 under normal circumstances.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Blessed Elves tend to be detached and view things in the long term. Since chaos and evil are unstable, almost all Blessed Elves are lawful or neutral good.</p><p>The Mortal Elves have a diverse range of alignments, more so than Humans. Sea Elves are overall neutral, with more spread in law/chaos than in good/evil. The danger of their undersea home makes many Sea Elves callous to others' misfortune, and jealousy of the Blessing drives some towards evil. Jungle Elves are outright evil as they seek to revive their god, a slain kraken, via blood sacrifices. On the other hand, Fey Elves are whimsical and lighthearted, invariably chaotic and generally good.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Elves are overall slenderer than Humans. Maladrin are slightly shorter than Humans, but the rest are about the same height on average.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Enhanced Darkvision.</em></strong> You have darkvision 60 feet. Furthermore, you can see in starlight as if it were bright light regardless of the actual light level, but distances beyond 60 feet are lightly obscured as if by mist. Instead of perceiving the usual color spectrum, most things under starlight take on shades of gray, but certain plants, animals, and minerals exhibit completely different colors that only Elves can see.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for half as long as normally required (still minimum 1 hour); see the rules on <a href='/settings/four-corners/rules.html#sleeping'>sleeping</a>. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.</p>
  <h4 id="high-elf-nauvir">High Elf (Nauvir)</h4><p><strong><em>Blessed.</em></strong> You do not grow old, and are immune to the effects of magical aging.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and one Human language. Most Blessed Elves know Sonnern, the language used for most arcane study and the basis for the modern Elvish alphabet. You can also read and write the Old Script, in which each glyph is topologically unique.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Cantrip.</em></strong> You know one cantrip of you choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. You can change the cantrip granted by this feature by spending 8 hours over the course of 2 days practicing. You can practice during short rests and long rests, but not while trancing.</p>
<h4 id="wood-elf-omavir">Wood Elf (Omavir)</h4><p><strong><em>Blessed.</em></strong> You do not grow old, and are immune to the effects of magical aging.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and one Human language. Most Blessed Elves know Sonnern, the language used for most arcane study and the basis for the modern Elvish alphabet. You can also read and write the Old Script, in which each glyph is topologically unique.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fleet of Foot.</em></strong> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Mask of the Wild.</em></strong> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Friend of Elks.</em></strong> You can speak Giant Elk. Giant elks share a home with Wood Elves in the hills of Verdania and respond to the call of a Wood Elf in need.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Home in the Trees.</em></strong> Your good balance and strong fingers are suited for climbing high in trees. You have advantage on Athletics made to climb trees or other plants. You are also able to rest comfortably in trees without risk of falling.</p>
<h4 id="sea-elf-maredrin">Sea Elf (Maredrin)</h4><p><strong><em>The King's Wish.</em></strong> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Marese and either Merrish or Tritonian. Marese is the native language of Maredrin, and many Maredrin have dealings with Merfolk or Tritons.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Underwater Camouflage.</em></strong> You have advantage on Stealth checks underwater.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Underwater Grace.</em></strong> When you take the Dodge action underwater, you also gain the benefits of the Dash and Disengage actions.</p>
<h4 id="jungle-elf-maledrin">Jungle Elf (Maledrin)</h4><p><strong><em>The King's Wish.</em></strong> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Malese. Malese is the native language of the Maledrin and is closely related to Marese.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Jungle Walker.</em></strong> Your body is built for climbing quickly and surely. You have a climbing speed of 20 feet and advantage on Acrobatics checks to avoid falling due to narrow walkspace. You also ignore difficult terrain due to dense plant growth.</p>
<h4 id="fey-elf-eladrin">Fey Elf (Eladrin)</h4><p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Sylvan and High Sylvan. High Sylvan branched off from Elvish long before the Blessing and is spoken only by the aristocracy of the Feywild, including most Eladrin. Sylvan is the vulgar form of High Sylvan and is spoken by common denizens of the Feywild.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Glamour.</em></strong> As an action, you can create an illusion to make yourself look different. The illusion lasts until you use an action to end it or to make a new illusion. The illusion does not affect your clothing or equipment and you cannot change your height or body shape, but otherwise the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p><p>The illusion fails to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this feature to add horns to your head, objects pass through the horns, and anyone who touches them would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.</p><p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Flare Glamour.</em></strong> Starting at 3rd level, you can flare your glamour for a more potent effect. When you use Glamour, you can augment your guise with any of the following otherworldly elements: an aura of light or darkness, up to a foot of increased height, altered clothing and equipment, indistinct sounds, or the amplification of your voice. You may also choose to evoke fear or awe. If you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you that can see and hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Glamour DC or be frightened (fear) or charmed (awe) until they can no longer see nor hear your Glamour, or until they take damage. You also have advantage on Charisma checks for the duration of the Glamour.</p><p>When you use your Glamour in this way, it ends after 1 minute, and you cannot use Glamour again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Your creature type is Humanoid and Fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Soul.</em></strong> Your soul is tied to the Feywild. You age half as quickly in the Feywild, but you cannot cast spells or use magic outside of it.</p><p>Some Eladrin have found ways of severing their tie and restoring their ability to use magic. One way (but not the only way) you can accomplish this is with the <a href='/settings/four-corners/feats.html#recovered-soul'>Recovered Soul</a> feat.</p>
