        <h1 id="elves">Elves</h1>
<p>Elves are native to the northern slopes of Verdania. They have long pointy ears and lean builds as a rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High elves: slightly taller, tan/copper skin, green-blue-white eyes, brown-gold hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wood elves: slightly shorter, light skin, green-yellow-brown eyes, brown-orange-red hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hair of non-immortal elves turns silver in old age (70+ years)</p>
<ul>
<li>Only sea elves and elves that were old before the Blessing have silver hair</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of the largest subgroups, wood elves and high elves, tend to live in isolated communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verdania is extremely poor in metals, so elves are generally inexperienced with metalwork. Instead, high elves make use of certain gemstones in the volcano. Peridot, spinel, and garnet are abundant, while pockets of quartz are scarce but rich. There is even well-hidden vein of kimberlite, named after the city built upon it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elves are unaging, and it is rare for one to die of violence or disease due to their wariness and medicinal expertise. This has significantly impacted Elvish culture. For instance, elves hold murder to be the worst crime, and children are uncommon. Every elf knows every other elf in his village or city, and it is common to know most elves in neighboring settlements as well. Most elves are masters of several disciplines, but those who have committed to one discipline are among the best in the world at it. Older elves spend more of their time meditating or practicing art.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wood-elves">Wood Elves</h3>
<p>Drawn to druidic magic, wood elves meld their homes and villages into the large sylvan trees near the coast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent hunters and gatherers, supplemented by magically-grown berries and wild vegetables.</li>
<li>Wood elves have no tamed animals, including horses. Instead, a wood elf that needs to move fast seeks out a wild giant elk to take them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-elves">High Elves</h3>
<p>High elves use their affinity for the arcane arts to construct hidden towers and citadels in the mountain ridges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since they keep the locations of their cities secret, high elf individuals from different cities meet in predetermined places in the wild to trade. This trading is facilitated by the <em>sending</em> spell.</li>
<li>High elves subsist entirely on magically-accelerated agriculture within their cities. They occasionally hunt dangerous beasts for glory, but never for food.</li>
<li>Some high elves have tamed griffons and use them for travel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sea-elves">Sea Elves</h2>
<p>The sea elves trace their ancestry to proto-Elven nobility. According to legend, Shaitan attempted to destroy a prosperous Elven kingdom by expelling so much lava from Verdoa that the kingdom sunk into the sea. The king, attempting to save everyone, <em>wished</em> for his people to be saved. Only his house was affected, becoming the first sea elves. The rest perished, and the ruins of the city lie at the bottom of the Verdan Gulf buried under hundreds of feet of cooled lava.</p>
<p>Sea elves were separated from their cousins before the Blessing, and never received the gift of immortality. They have generally remained in the Verdan Gulf, occasionally venturing out to trade with Triton. Like the Triton and Merfolk, sea elves despise Merrow and patrol the gulf to keep them out.</p>
<h2 id="settlements">Settlements</h2>
<p>Elves do not have kingdoms or even city-states. Each settlement, be it village or city, is fully autonomous and self-sufficient. Below is a list of these settlements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The suffix -arz denotes a citadel, and -or or -oth denotes a village.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elvish vocabulary is based on Latin and modified to resemble Hawai'ian.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modern Elvish alphabet is phonetic and based on Human script. Elves no longer use the Elder Elvish script in academic work due to the influence of prolific Human mages. The old script is still used by Elvish artists, since the symbols are unique up to homeomorphisms, allowing for extreme calligraphic freedom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elves do not use the letters 'k' or 'x'</li>

<li>'e' is either pronounced [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e̞</a>​] as in "let" or is a schwa [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a>]</li>
