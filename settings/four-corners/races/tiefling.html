        <h1 id="tiefling">Tiefling</h1>

<div class='p'>A tiefling, which translates roughly to "low one" in Sonnern, is a cursed being. A child of any race may be born a tiefling, and virtually any parent would abandon such a child as soon as the curse became evident. Tieflings are shunned by most people due to prejudices and fears—which may be justified—concerning them. It is well-known that tiefling behave erratically, and many people believe that their supernatural visage and powers mark them as evil.</div>

<h2 id="the-curse">The Curse</h2>

<div class='p'>The Tiefling's Curse usually manifests as oddly colored skin, hair, and eyes, with the eyes being completely monochromatic. These traits may not appear until the tiefling child is a year old. In extreme cases, a tiefling can have horns, sharp teeth, claws instead of nails, slits for a nose, or even a tail; these traits appear much sooner, even before birth.</div>

<div class='p'>The true impact of the Curse is mental, not physical. A tiefling gets impulses to act either chaotically or orderly, and feels discomfort from resisting these impulses. Some tieflings even hear voices encouraging such behaviors. The Curse strengthens with age, both mentally and physically. When a tiefling fully succumbs to the Curse, they act solely on these impulses for few years before entering a coma and ultimately dying. The <a href="../feats.html#peak-of-corruption">peak of corruption</a> feat represents the exceptional tiefling whose Curse-effected deformities are beneficial.</div>

<div class='p'>Magic can remove the Curse and banish the impulses entirely. This comes at the cost of losing certain powers, but is often preferable to insanity.</div>

<div class='p'>It is possible to end the Curse in such a way that a tiefling gains powers instead of losing them. This happens extremely rarely, and apparently only to tieflings who embrace their impulses. The <a href="../feats.html#amalgamated-chaos">amalgamated chaos</a> and <a href="../feats.html#amalgamated-order">amalgamated order</a> feats represents this transition.</div>

<div class="medium-card">
    <h1 id="tiefling">Tiefling</h1>
    <div class='p'><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Tieflings generally inherit the physical attributes of their parents. They often have rough childhoods and learn to be quick, cunning, or charismatic to survive.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Age.</i></b> All tieflings eventually succomb to the Tiefling's Curse, reducing their lifespan to about two-thirds of what would otherwise be expected from their heritage.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Atrophic tiefling are supernaturally drawn to freedom and chaos, while leguleian tieflings are discomforted by lies and broken laws. The vicious upbringing of many tieflings may exacerbate these tendencies. Some tieflings resist, although it takes constant effort and gets more difficult with age.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Inherited Traits.</i></b> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Fiendish Soul.</i></b> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as a Fiend to abilities that detect fiends.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Tiefling's Curse.</i></b> You are cursed. The Curse manifests in the following ways, depending on your subrace:</div>
<ul><li>You feel impulses towards chaos (Atrophic) or order (Leguleian).
</li><li>You are discomforted when chaos (Atrophic) or order (Leguleian) is not upheld.
</li><li>You have the Atrophic Spells or Leguleian Spells trait.
</li></ul>

<div class='p'>If <i>remove curse</i> is cast on you, the Curse is lifted from you for 1 minute, temporarily ending the above effects of the Curse. If <i>remove curse</i> was cast at a higher level, the Curse is lifted for longer: 1 day at 5th or 6th level, 1 month at 7th or 8th level, or 1 year at 9th level.</div>
    <h2 id="atrophic-tiefling">Atrophic Tiefling</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Atrophic Resistance.</i></b> You have resistance to necrotic damage.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Atrophic Spells.</i></b> You know the <i>thaumaturgy</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you learn the <i>inflict wounds</i> spell. When you reach 5th level, you learn the <i>crown of madness</i> spell. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</div>
<h2 id="leguleian-tiefling">Leguleian Tiefling</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Leguleian Resistance.</i></b> You have resistance to fire damage.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Leguleian Spells.</i></b> You know the <i>thaumaturgy</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you learn the <i>hellish rebuke</i> spell. When you reach 5th level, you learn the <i>zone of truth</i> spell. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</div>
