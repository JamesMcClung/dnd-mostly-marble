        <h1 id="tiefling">Tiefling</h1>

<p>A tiefling, which translates roughly to "low one" in Sonnern, is a cursed being. A child of any race may be born a tiefling, and virtually any parent would abandon such a child as soon as the curse became evident. Tieflings are shunned by most people due to prejudices and fears—which may be justified—concerning them. It is well-known that tiefling behave erratically, and many people believe that their supernatural visage and powers mark them as evil.</p>

<h2 id="the-curse">The Curse</h2>

<p>The Tiefling's Curse usually manifests as oddly colored skin, hair, and eyes, with the eyes being completely monochromatic. These traits may not appear until the tiefling child is a year old. In extreme cases, a tiefling can have horns, sharp teeth, claws instead of nails, slits for a nose, or even a tail; these traits appear much sooner, even before birth.</p>

<p>The true impact of the Curse is mental, not physical. A tiefling gets impulses to act either chaotically or orderly, and feels discomfort from resisting these impulses. Some tieflings even hear voices encouraging such behaviors. The Curse strengthens with age, both mentally and physically. When a tiefling fully succumbs to the Curse, they act solely on these impulses for few years before entering a coma and ultimately dying. The <a href="../feats.html#peak-of-corruption">peak of corruption</a> feat represents the exceptional tiefling whose Curse-effected deformities are beneficial.</p>

<p>Magic can remove the Curse and banish the impulses entirely. This comes at the cost of losing certain powers, but is often preferable to insanity.</p>

<p>It is possible to end the Curse in such a way that a tiefling gains powers instead of losing them. This happens extremely rarely, and apparently only to tieflings who embrace their impulses. The <a href="../feats.html#amalgamated-chaos">amalgamated chaos</a> and <a href="../feats.html#amalgamated-order">amalgamated order</a> feats represents this transition.</p>

    <p><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Tieflings generally inherit the physical attributes of their parents. They often have rough childhoods and learn to be quick, cunning, or charismatic to survive.</p>
<script src='/js/sortTable.js'></script>
<script src='/js/drag.js'></script>
<p><b><i>Age.</i></b> All tieflings eventually succomb to the Tiefling's Curse, reducing their lifespan to about two-thirds of what would otherwise be expected from their heritage.</p>
<script src='/js/sortTable.js'></script>
<script src='/js/drag.js'></script>
<p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Atrophic tiefling are supernaturally drawn to freedom and chaos, while leguleian tieflings are discomforted by lies and broken laws. The vicious upbringing of many tieflings may exacerbate these tendencies. Some tieflings resist, although it takes constant effort and gets more difficult with age.</p>
<script src='/js/sortTable.js'></script>

<p><b><i>Tiefling's Curse.</i></b> You are cursed. The Curse manifests in the following ways, depending on your subrace:</p>
<ul><li>You feel impulses towards chaos (Atrophic) or order (Leguleian).
</li><li>You are discomforted when chaos (Atrophic) or order (Leguleian) is not upheld.
</li><li>You have the Atrophic Spells or Leguleian Spells trait.
</li></ul>

<p>If <i>remove curse</i> is cast on you, the Curse is lifted from you for 1 minute, temporarily ending the above effects of the Curse.

<p>When <i>remove curse</i> is cast on you, you must make a Constitution saving throw against the spell save DC. On a success, your Tiefling's Curse is not lifted.</p>

</li><li>Your tail, horns, and/or claws are empowered by your Curse and you can use them to make unarmed strikes. They count as magical natural weapons with the finesse and light properties, have a damage die of 1d8, and deal bludgeoning damage (tail), piercing damage (horns), or slashing damage (claws). Once on each of your turns, you can cause a creature hit by one of your unarmed strikes to take an extra 1d8 fire damage (Leguleian tiefling) or necrotic damage (Atrophic tiefling).
