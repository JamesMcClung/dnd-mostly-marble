        <h1 id="elf">Elf</h1>

<div class='p'>Elves are native to the northern slopes of Verdania. They have long pointy ears and lean builds as a rule.</div>
<ul><li>High elves: slightly taller, tan/copper skin, green-blue-white eyes, brown-gold hair
</li><li>Wood elves: slightly shorter, light skin, green-yellow-brown eyes, brown-orange-red hair
</li><li>Hair turns silver in old age (70+ years)
<ul><li>Only mortal elves and elves that were old before the Blessing have silver hair
</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<ul><li>Both of the largest subgroups, wood elves and high elves, tend to live in isolated communities.
</li><li>Verdania is extremely poor in metals, so elves are generally inexperienced with metalwork. Instead, high elves make use of certain gemstones in the volcano. Peridot, spinel, and garnet are abundant, while pockets of quartz are scarce but rich. There is even well-hidden vein of kimberlite, named after the city built upon it.
</li><li>Elves are unaging, and it is rare for one to die of violence or disease due to their wariness and medicinal expertise. This has significantly impacted Elvish culture. For instance, elves hold murder to be the worst crime, and children are uncommon. Every elf knows every other elf in his village or city, and it is common to know most elves in neighboring settlements as well. Most elves are masters of several disciplines, but those who have committed to one discipline are among the best in the world at it. Older elves spend more of their time meditating or practicing art.
</li></ul>

<h3 id="wood-elves-omavir">Wood Elves (Omavir)</h3>
<div class='p'>Drawn to druidic magic, wood elves meld their homes and villages into the large redwood-like trees near the coast.</div>

<ul><li>Excellent hunters and gatherers, supplemented by magically-grown berries and wild vegetables.
</li><li>Wood elves have no tamed animals, including horses. Instead, a wood elf that needs to move fast seeks out a wild giant elk to take them.
</li></ul>

<h3 id="high-elves-nauvir">High Elves (Nauvir)</h3>
<div class='p'>High elves use their affinity for the arcane arts to construct hidden towers and citadels in the mountain ridges.</div>

<ul><li>Since they keep the locations of their cities secret, high elf individuals from different cities meet in predetermined places in the wild to trade. This trading is facilitated by the <i>sending</i> spell.
</li><li>High elves subsist entirely on magically-accelerated agriculture within their cities. They occasionally hunt dangerous beasts for glory, but never for food.
</li><li>Some high elves have tamed griffons and use them for travel.
</li></ul>

<h3 id="settlements">Settlements</h3>

<div class='p'>Blessed Elves do not have kingdoms or even city-states. Each settlement, be it village or city, is fully autonomous and self-sufficient. Below is a list of these settlements.</div>

<ul><li>The suffix -arys denotes a citadel, and -or or -oth denotes a village.
</li></ul>

<h2 id="mortal-elves">Mortal Elves</h2>

<div class='p'>Mortal Elves were separated from their cousins before the Blessing, and never received the gift of immortality.</div>

<h3 id="sea-elves-maredrin">Sea Elves (Maredrin)</h3>
<div class='p'>Jungle and Sea Elves trace their ancestry to proto-Elven nobility. According to legend, Shaitan attempted to destroy a prosperous Elven kingdom by expelling so much lava from Verdoa that the land sunk into the sea. Their ruler King Mo'ire, attempting to save everyone, <i>wished</i> for his people to be saved. Only his house was affected, becoming the first Sea Elves. The rest perished, and the ruins of the city lie at the bottom of the Verdan Gulf buried under hundreds of feet of cooled lava.</div>

<div class='p'>Sea Elves, or <i>Maredrin</i> in their language, have generally remained in the Verdan Gulf, occasionally venturing out to trade with Triton. Maredrin despise Sahuagin and patrol the gulf to keep them—and other marine threats—out. They worship their ancestors, especially the ancient king who saved them. The Maredrin tend to be envious of the Blessing and are especially bitter about the relative safety that the Blessed Elves enjoy, which they claim is thanks to their efforts.</div>

<h3 id="jungle-elves-maledrin">Jungle Elves (Maledrin)</h3>
<div class='p'>Relatively recently, one faction of Maredrin was exiled and forced to live on land. These became the Jungle Elves, or <i>Maledrin</i> (also spelled <i>Maladrin</i>), who inhabit the mangrove swamps and tropical jungles of Verdania. Their crime was worshipping the kraken they named Lolugo. The kraken was slain long ago by a coalition of Triton and Maredrin, but the Maledrin continue to worship it as their true god.</div>

<div class='p'>The Maledrin believe that Lolugo can be brought back by blood sacrifices and aberrant magic in a practice called <a href="../religion.html">Aquorism</a>. They worship aberrations as lesser gods. &lt;redacted> In combat, the Maledrin take captives in order to ritually sacrifice them later. They occasionally ambush Maredrin patrols, but they are especially fond of hunting Merfolk. A Maledrin captain who fails to take enough captives must sacrifice members of his own family as punishment.</div>

<h3 id="fey-elves-eladrin">Fey Elves (Eladrin)</h3>
<div class='p'><a href="../timeline.html">15,000 years ago</a>, the Eladrin were a group of proto-Elves who were taken in by a new god, Pahi. According to legend his prophet, a nymph called Uhane, convinced them to sacrifice their souls to help create an entirely new world for them to rule. &lt;redacted> This parallel reality, initially only a mirroring a small portion of Verdania, gradually grew to become the <a href="../planes/feywild.html">Feywild</a>. The Eladrin no longer rule the Feywild alone, as it simply too big now and more creatures inhabit it.</div>

<h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2>


<div class="medium-card">
    <h1 id="elf">Elf</h1>
    <div class='p'><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Like all elves, Blessed elves are naturally graceful and have keen senses. Due to their age, they are often knowledgeable as well. Blessed elves have above-average Dexterity, as well as Intelligence and/or Wisdom.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Age.</i></b> Thanks to an ancient boon from their god, the Blessed elves are immune to old age. The only Blessed elves who are visibly aged are the Elders, who were already old when they received the Blessing 12,000 years ago. All elves reach physical maturity at about the same rate as humans, although a Blessed elf is considered young until they are at least a century old. Blessed elves are extremely cautious in battle so as not to die, and children are rare as the birthrate has steadily dropped since the Blessing. Most Blessed elves are over 5,000 years old, although wars with hobgoblins took heavy tolls from some of the older generations.</div>

<div class='p'>The mortal elves have comparable lives to humans, having an <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#old-age">old age</a> threshold of 70 years and an aging rate of 5 years.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Blessed elves tend to be detached and view things in the long term. Since chaos and evil are unstable, almost all Blessed elves are lawful or neutral good.</div>

<div class='p'>The mortal elves have a diverse range of alignments, more so than humans. Sea elves are overall neutral, with more spread in law/chaos than in good/evil. The danger of their undersea home makes many Sea elves callous to others' misfortune, and jealousy of the Blessing drives some towards evil. Jungle elves are outright evil as they seek to revive their god, a slain kraken, via blood sacrifices. On the other hand, Fey elves are whimsical and lighthearted, invariably chaotic and generally good.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Size.</i></b> Your size is Medium. Elves are overall slenderer than humans. Maledrin are slightly shorter than humans, but the rest are about the same height on average.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Enhanced Darkvision.</i></b> You have darkvision 60 feet. Furthermore, you can see in starlight as if it were bright light regardless of the actual light level, but distances beyond 60 feet are lightly obscured as if by mist. Instead of perceiving the usual color spectrum, most things under starlight take on shades of gray, but certain plants, animals, and minerals exhibit completely different colors that only elves can see.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Trance.</i></b> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for half as long as normally required (still minimum 1 hour); see the rules on <a href="/settings/four-corners/rules.html#sleeping">sleeping</a>. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.</div>
    <h2 id="high-elf-nauvir">High Elf (Nauvir)</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Blessed.</i></b> You do not grow old, and are immune to the effects of magical aging.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and one human language. Most Blessed elves know Sonnern, the language used for most arcane study and the basis for the modern Elvish alphabet. You can also read and write the Old Script, in which each glyph is topologically unique.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Cantrip.</i></b> You know one cantrip of you choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. You can change the cantrip granted by this feature by spending 8 hours over the course of 2 days practicing. You can practice during short rests and long rests, but not while trancing.</div>
<h2 id="wood-elf-omavir">Wood Elf (Omavir)</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Blessed.</i></b> You do not grow old, and are immune to the effects of magical aging.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and one human language. Most Blessed elves know Sonnern, the language used for most arcane study and the basis for the modern Elvish alphabet. You can also read and write the Old Script, in which each glyph is topologically unique.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Fleet of Foot.</i></b> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Mask of the Wild.</i></b> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Friend of Beasts.</i></b> Through sounds and gestures, you can convey simple ideas to Medium and Large beasts, and understand their emotional state. You have advantage on Animal Handling checks made on such beasts.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Home in the Trees.</i></b> Your good balance and strong fingers are suited for climbing high in trees. You have advantage on Athletics made to climb trees or other plants. You are also able to rest comfortably in trees without risk of falling.</div>
<h2 id="sea-elf-maredrin">Sea Elf (Maredrin)</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>The King's Wish.</i></b> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Marese and either Merrish or Tritonian. Marese is the native language of Maredrin, and many Maredrin have dealings with Merfolk or Tritons.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Underwater Camouflage.</i></b> You have advantage on Stealth checks underwater.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Underwater Grace.</i></b> When you take the Dodge action underwater, you also gain the benefits of the Dash and Disengage actions.</div>
<h2 id="jungle-elf-maledrin">Jungle Elf (Maledrin)</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>The King's Wish.</i></b> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Malese. Malese is the native language of the Maledrin and is closely related to Marese.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Jungle Walker.</i></b> Your body is built for climbing quickly and surely. You have a climbing speed of 20 feet and advantage on Acrobatics checks to avoid falling due to narrow walkspace. You also ignore difficult terrain due to dense plant growth.</div>
<h2 id="fey-elf-eladrin">Fey Elf (Eladrin)</h2>
<div class='p'><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Sylvan and High Sylvan. High Sylvan branched off from Elvish long before the Blessing and is spoken only by the aristocracy of the Feywild, including most Eladrin. Sylvan is the vulgar form of High Sylvan and is spoken by common denizens of the Feywild.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Fey Ancestry.</i></b> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as a Fey to abilities that detect fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Glamour.</i></b> As a standard action, you can create an illusion to make yourself look different. The illusion lasts until you use a standard action to end it or to make a new illusion. The illusion does not affect your clothing or equipment and you cannot change your height or body shape, but otherwise the extent of the illusion is up to you.</div>

<div class='p'>The illusion fails to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this feature to add horns to your head, objects pass through the horns, and anyone who touches them would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.</div>

<div class='p'>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use a standard action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Flare Glamour.</i></b> Starting at 3rd level, you can flare your glamour for a more potent effect. When you use Glamour, you can augment your guise with any of the following otherworldly elements: an aura of light or darkness, up to a foot of increased height, altered clothing and equipment, indistinct sounds, or the amplification of your voice. You have advantage on Charisma checks for the duration of the Glamour.</div>

<div class='p'>You may also choose to evoke fear or awe. If you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you that can see and hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Glamour DC or be frightened (fear) or charmed (awe) until they can no longer see nor hear your Glamour, or until they take damage.</div>

<div class='p'>When you use your Glamour in this way, it ends after 1 minute, and you cannot use Glamour again until you finish a short or long rest.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Feybound.</i></b> Your soul is tied to the Feywild. You age half as quickly in the Feywild and can sense a creature's <a href="/settings/four-corners/planes/feywild.html#karma">karma</a>, but you cannot cast spells or use magic outside of it.</div>

<div class='p'>Some individuals have found ways of severing their tie and restoring their ability to use magic. One way (but not the only way) you can accomplish this is with the <a href="/settings/four-corners/feats.html#severed-bonds">Severed Bonds</a> feat.</div>
</div>

<h2 id="suggested-feat">Suggested Feat</h2>


<div class="small-card">
    <h1 id="severed-bonds">Severed Bonds</h1>
    <div class="p card-subheader"><i>Prerequisite: Feybound racial trait<br>Cost: 3 feat points</i></div>
    <div class='p'>Somehow, you have severed your soul's connection to the Feywild. Before taking this feat, discuss the means by which you accomplish this with your DM, as it may be narratively significant. You gain the following benefits and drawback:</div>
<ul><li>You lose your Feybound racial trait (and this feat ceases to have any prerequisites for you).
</li><li>You can expel your spirit from your body to cast <span class="popupAnchor" id="anchor0" onclick="toggleDragEnabled(popup0, options={event:event})" onmouseover="showPopup(popup0, anchor0)" onmouseout="hidePopup(popup0)"><i>arcane eye</i></span> without any components once with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. When you cast the spell in this way, you create a miniature version of yourself instead of an eye. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest.
</li><li>It takes 1 less failed death saving throw for you to die.

    <div class='p'>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</div>

<div class='p'>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</div>

<h4 id="half-cover">Half Cover</h4>
<div class='p'>A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</div>

<h4 id="three-quarters-cover">Three-Quarters Cover</h4>
<div class='p'>A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</div>

<h4 id="total-cover">Total Cover</h4>
<div class='p'>A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</div>

    <div class='p'>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A <i>greater restoration</i> spell cast on you ends this effect.</div>

<div class='p'>On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.</div>
