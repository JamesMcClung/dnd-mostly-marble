<div class='p'>Dwarves are native to the mountains of Gabroria. They are universally short and stocky, ranging from 4-5 feet tall but easily weighing 150-230 pounds. Dwarfmen almost always sport impressive beards.</div>

<div class='p'>There are a handful of distinct Dwarvish nations. Each nation specializes in processing the resources present in or around their capital.</div>
<ul><li>Iron Dwarves: largest kingdom with ample iron
<ul><li>primary subrace: Mountain
</li><li>started small but quickly took land from Bronze Dwarves
</li><li>elite subcategory: Steel Dwarves
<ul><li>responsible for binding Shaitan in Helvete after stealing work from Adamant Dwarves
</li></ul>
</li><li>entered Æði (Behemoth) Pact with Granite Dwarves: Granite Dwarves help bolster Helvete against Behemoth's attacks in exchange for iron, steel, and freedom to study Shaitan. Pact rendered moot while Behemoth is bound.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Gold Dwarves: small group of cities that is rarely independent
<ul><li>primary subrace: Deep
</li><li>perpetual subjects of other nations, currently Iron Kingdom
</li><li>terrible quality of life for working class, which most Gold Dwarves are
</li><li>story of a group of gold dwarves who tried to escape slavery by fleeing into underdark and never returned
</li></ul>
</li><li>East & West Silver Dwarves: actually two kingdoms separated by the Fjordbukta
<ul><li>primary subrace: Fjord
</li><li>the east kingdom came first and colonized the west side, which later declared independence
</li><li>only dwarves to have a navy
</li></ul>
</li><li>Bronze Dwarves: medium-sized kingdom with lots of copper
<ul><li>primary subrace: Mountain
</li><li>once the largest kingdom, but lost territory to Iron Dwarves
</li><li>lots of trade with Gnomes and Dwarves, especially Pewter Dwarves
</li><li>most inventive Dwarves due to utility of copper and cultural exchange with Gnomes
</li><li>starting to use brass
</li></ul>
</li><li>Pewter Dwarves: smallish kingdom with tin
<ul><li>primary subrace: Mountain
</li><li>historically home of the best small-scale artisans
</li><li>increasing in power due to trade with Gnomes and other Dwarves as more uses of tin are found (e.g. canning)
</li></ul>
</li><li>Adamant Dwarves: single (now deserted) volcanic city that was the only source of adamant
<ul><li>primary subrace: Cinder
</li><li>needed very high temperatures to process raw adamant, forming a bottleneck to production
</li><li>feared invasion by Iron Dwarves and were desparate for an advantage
</li><li>attempted to bind Shaitan in their city to increase adamant smelting, but failed and were destroyed
</li></ul>
</li><li>Granite Dwarves: large kingdom with uniquely durable granite
<ul><li>primary subrace: Hill
</li><li>only dwarves to build bulk of cities above ground
</li><li>also known for abundance of certain gem-quality minerals
<ul><li>in order of increasing scarcity/value: quartz (rutile, rose, & plain), fluorite, tourmaline (schorl & watermelon), zircon, moonstone, topaz, beryl (emerald & aquamarine), titanite
</li></ul>
</li><li>master masons: best architecture by far, including aqueducts carrying water to power public baths & sewer system
</li><li>most peaceful of all dwarves due to relative lack of weapons-grade metals, but defenses have never been breached
</li><li>largest population of wizards
</li><li>used to get iron and steel from Iron Dwarves through Æði Pact before Behemoths's binding; now short on iron
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
