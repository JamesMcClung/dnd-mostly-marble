<div class='p'>Dwarves are native to the mountains of Gabroria. They are universally short and stocky, ranging from 4-5 feet tall but easily weighing 150-230 pounds. Dwarfmen almost always sport impressive beards.</div>

<div class='p'>There are a handful of distinct Dwarvish nations. Each nation specializes in processing the resources present in or around their capital.</div>
<ul><li>Iron Dwarves: largest kingdom with ample iron
<ul><li>primary subrace: Mountain
</li><li>started small but quickly took land from Bronze Dwarves
</li><li>elite subcategory: Steel Dwarves
<ul><li>responsible for binding Shaitan in Helvete after stealing work from Adamant Dwarves
</li></ul>
</li><li>entered Æði (Behemoth) Pact with Granite Dwarves: Granite Dwarves help bolster Helvete against Behemoth's attacks in exchange for iron, steel, and freedom to study Shaitan. Pact rendered moot while Behemoth is bound.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Gold Dwarves: small group of cities that is rarely independent
<ul><li>primary subrace: Deep
</li><li>perpetual subjects of other nations, currently Iron Kingdom
</li><li>terrible quality of life for working class, which most Gold Dwarves are
</li><li>story of a group of gold dwarves who tried to escape slavery by fleeing into underdark and never returned
</li></ul>
</li><li>East & West Silver Dwarves: actually two kingdoms separated by the Fjordbukta
<ul><li>primary subrace: Fjord
</li><li>the east kingdom came first and colonized the west side, which later declared independence
</li><li>only dwarves to have a navy
</li></ul>
</li><li>Bronze Dwarves: medium-sized kingdom with lots of copper
<ul><li>primary subrace: Mountain
</li><li>once the largest kingdom, but lost territory to Iron Dwarves
</li><li>lots of trade with Gnomes and Dwarves, especially Pewter Dwarves
</li><li>most inventive Dwarves due to utility of copper and cultural exchange with Gnomes
</li><li>starting to use brass
</li></ul>
</li><li>Pewter Dwarves: smallish kingdom with tin
<ul><li>primary subrace: Mountain
</li><li>historically home of the best small-scale artisans
</li><li>increasing in power due to trade with Gnomes and other Dwarves as more uses of tin are found (e.g. canning)
</li></ul>
</li><li>Adamant Dwarves: single (now deserted) volcanic city that was the only source of adamant
<ul><li>primary subrace: Cinder
</li><li>needed very high temperatures to process raw adamant, forming a bottleneck to production
</li><li>feared invasion by Iron Dwarves and were desparate for an advantage
</li><li>attempted to bind Shaitan in their city to increase adamant smelting, but failed and were destroyed
</li></ul>
</li><li>Granite Dwarves: large kingdom with uniquely durable granite
<ul><li>primary subrace: Hill
</li><li>only dwarves to build bulk of cities above ground
</li><li>also known for abundance of certain gem-quality minerals
<ul><li>in order of increasing scarcity/value: quartz (rutile, rose, & plain), fluorite, tourmaline (schorl & watermelon), zircon, moonstone, topaz, beryl (emerald & aquamarine), titanite
</li></ul>
</li><li>master masons: best architecture by far, including aqueducts carrying water to power public baths & sewer system
</li><li>most peaceful of all dwarves due to relative lack of weapons-grade metals, but defenses have never been breached
</li><li>largest population of wizards
</li><li>used to get iron and steel from Iron Dwarves through Æði Pact before Behemoths's binding; now short on iron
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="names">Names</h2>

<div class='p'>Dwarves have a first name, a clan name, and rarely an epithet.</div>

<h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2>


<div class="medium-card">
    <h1 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h1>
    <div class='p'><b><i>Abilities.</i></b> Dwarves are exceptionally hardy by nature, and feats of strength, endurance, and courage are greatly admired in most Dwarvish cultures. As such, Dwarves have a significantly higher Strength and Constitution on average, and individual dwarves may possess high Wisdom or Charisma.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Age.</i></b> Due to their impressive fortitudes, dwarves rarely get sick at any age. Your <a href="/settings/four-corners/glossary.html#old-age">old age</a> threshold is 200 years, with an aging rate of 5 years.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Dwarvish cultures generally hold strongly to their laws and traditions, which are literally set in stone in most communities. Dwarves tend strongly towards lawful.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish. Due to the dwarves' long lifespans and opposition to social change, the language hasn't changed much over time. Dwarvish serves as the common language of Gabroria, although there are noticeable differences in dialect between distant regions.</div>
<div class='p'><b><i>Size.</i></b> Your size is Medium. Despite averaging 4 feet tall, Dwarves are truly big-boned and often weigh over 200 pounds.</div>
