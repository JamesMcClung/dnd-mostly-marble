        <h1 id="genasi">Genasi</h1>
<p>Genasi are individuals infused with an element: air, earth, fire, or water. A genasi can be born to parents of any race.</p>
<h2 id="fall-of-nature">Fall of Nature</h2>
<p>Legends tell of genasi who could rival a <a href="/settings/four-corners/primordials.html">Primordial</a> with their elemental power. Such legends may have been exaggerated, but genasi power is certainly in decline. In living memory, no genasi has been more innately powerful than a typical elemental. It is postulated that the binding of the Primordials is somehow the cause of the decline.</p>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="genasi">Genasi</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Genasi inherit the abilities of their parents, with some alterations. Earth and water genasi tend to be stronger and slower, while air and fire genasi tend to be weaker and faster. All varieties of genasi have a higher-than-average Constitution.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Genasi are generally healthier than normal, but have the same lifespan as their parents.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Genasi have no supernatural proclivities towards any alignment. A genasi's upbringing may be unusual and influence their alignment, but genasi generally do not have such cursed childhoods as tieflings or exalted childhoods as aasimar.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Inherited Traits.</em></strong> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Elemental Soul.</em></strong> Your creature type is Humanoid, but you also register as an Elemental to abilities that detect elementals.</p>
  <h4 id="air-genasi">Air Genasi</h4><p><strong><em>Air Resistances.</em></strong> You have resistance to thunder damage and to bludgeoning damage inflicted by wind.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Soul of Air.</em></strong> You know the <i>gust</i> cantrip. You can learn additional spells from this trait if you take the Air Genasi Magic feat. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Jet Boost.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can propel yourself in a straight line in any direction a number of feet equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. This motion does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Unending Breath.</em></strong> You can hold your breath indefinitely while you're not incapacitated.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Aerial Grace.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can begin to focus on the air around and use it to guide your movement. While you are in air, unencumbered, and maintain concentration, as if on a spell, you gain the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>You weigh half as much as normal.</li> <li>When you fall, your rate of descent cannot exceed 60 feet per round. You take no falling damage and can land on your feet, and you can travel 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend by spending 1 foot of movement.</li> <li>You have advantage on Acrobatics checks.</li></ul>.
<h4 id="earth-genasi">Earth Genasi</h4><p><strong><em>Earth Resistances.</em></strong> You have resistance to lightning damage and to bludgeoning damage inflicted by earth.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Soul of Earth.</em></strong> You know the <i>mold earth</i> cantrip. You can learn additional spells from this trait if you take the Earth Genasi Magic feat. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Stonewalker.</em></strong> You ignore difficult terrain made of earth or stone.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Defensive Pillars.</em></strong> When you are on the ground and you would be hit by a ranged attack or fail a Dexterity saving throw from a source you can see, you can use your reaction to gain half cover against the triggering effect, potentially causing the attack to miss or the saving throw to succeed. Doing so takes a great amount of sudden focus; if you are concentrating when you use this reaction, you lose concentration.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Earthen Strength.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can begin to focus on the earth beneath you and tap into its strength and stability. While you are on the ground and maintain concentration, as if on a spell, you gain the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>At the start of each of your turns, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. They vanish if you lose concentration.</li> <li>You have tremorsense out to a distance of 15 feet.</li> <li>You have advantage on Athletics checks.</li></ul>
<h4 id="fire-genasi">Fire Genasi</h4><p><strong><em>Fire Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to fire damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Soul of Fire.</em></strong> You know the <i>control flames</i> cantrip. You can learn additional spells from this trait if you take the Fire Genasi Magic feat. You can cast each of these spells once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race), and you require no material components when you do so.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Flameburst.</em></strong> You have a ranged spell attack. The attack has a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you use the ability you chose for your Soul of Fire trait for its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is fire, and its damage die is a d6.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Disperse Heat.</em></strong> When you would take fire damage, you can use your reaction to become immune to the triggering fire damage. Doing so takes a great amount of sudden focus; if you are concentrating when you use this reaction, you lose concentration.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fiery Brilliance.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can let fire consume and invigorate you. While you maintain concentration, as if on a spell, you gain the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>Harmless wisps of fire coil off you, shedding bright light out to a radius of 10 feet and dim light an additional 10 feet.</li> <li>Once on each of your turns when you cause a creature to take fire damage, you can cause that creature to take additional fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</li> <li>You have advantage on Intimidation checks.</li> </ul>
<h4 id="water-genasi">Water Genasi</h4><p><strong><em>Water Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to acid damage and to bludgeoning damage inflicted by water.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Soul of Water.</em></strong> You know the <i>shape water</i> cantrip. You can learn additional spells from this trait if you take the Water Genasi Magic feat.

  <p><strong><em>Natural Healer.</em></strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and allow it to spend 1 hit die, roll it, and regain hit points equal to the result (its Constitution modifier is not added). This action has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Aquatic Serenity.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can begin attuning yourself to the water within and around you. While you maintain concentration, as if on a spell, you gain the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>Your swimming speed increases to 60 feet.</li> <li>Once on each of your turns when you cause a creature to regain hit points, that creature can regain additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</li> <li>You have advantage on Medicine checks.</li></ul>
