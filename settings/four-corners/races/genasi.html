        <h1 id="genasi">Genasi</h1>
<p>Genasi are individuals infused with an element: air, earth, fire, or water. A genasi can be born to parents of any race.</p>
<h2 id="fall-of-nature">Fall of Nature</h2>
<p>Legends tell of genasi who could rival a <a href="/settings/four-corners/primordials.html">Primordial</a> with their elemental power. Such legends may have been exaggerated, but genasi power is certainly in decline. In living memory, no genasi has been more innately powerful than a typical elemental. It is postulated that the binding of the Primordials is somehow the cause of the decline.</p>

  <h3 id="genasi">Genasi</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Genasi inherit the abilities of their parents, with some alterations. Earth and water genasi tend to be stronger and slower, while air and fire genasi tend to be weaker and faster. All varieties of genasi have a higher-than-average Constitution.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Genasi are generally healthier than normal, but have the same lifespan as their parents.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Genasi have no supernatural proclivities towards any alignment. A genasi's upbringing may be unusual and influence their alignment, but genasi generally do not have such cursed childhoods as tieflings or exalted childhoods as aasimar.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Inherited Traits.</em></strong> Your size, base walking speed, and languages are inherited from your parents' race. You also inherit any trait that grants a climbing, swimming, or flying speed, or the ability to breathe underwater.</p>
