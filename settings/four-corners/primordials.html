        <h1 id="the-primordials">The Primordials</h1>
<p>The four Primordials are the greatest elementals, each embodying their respective element. They are as old as the world itself. For most of history, the Primordials kept the spread of civilization in check by amplifying natural disasters to apocalyptic proportions. Recently, three of four of the Primordials were bound, and no longer impede progress or <a href="expansion.html">expansion</a>.</p>
<p>Both technological and arcane progress were hampered by the severity and frequency of natural disasters. Libraries, academies, and monasteries were built only to be leveled in an earthquake, razed by fire, swallowed in a flood, or blown apart by storms. For this reason, much of <a href="races.html">human and halfling history</a> is lost.</p>
<h2 id="binding-of-the-primordials">Binding of the Primordials</h2>
<p>The idea of removing the threat of the Primordials was a fever dream for millenia before being promoted to mere wishful thinking when a dwarvish wizard invented a process called <a href="binding.html"><em>binding</em></a>. Eventually, binding was developed to the point where it might be applied to a Primordial.</p>
<p>500 years ago, the dwarves managed to bind the Primordial of Fire in their Mountain of Flame. Over the following centuries, the idea of imprisoning Leviathan in a similar way began to take shape, and humans began their conquest in earnest 250 years ago. It took 150 years and many human generations to finally chase Leviathan to the Iceplains and there bind it.</p>
<p>The Primordial of Earth was captured and bound soon after by the gnomes, also in Gabroria. Now only the Primordial of Air remains free, though many humans and gnomes seek to bind it too.</p>
