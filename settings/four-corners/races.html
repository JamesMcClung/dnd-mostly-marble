        <h1 id="the-races">The Races</h1>
<p>The major races include Humans, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Elves. Each of these races lays claim to a significant <a href="world.html">area of land</a>, which the other major races (more or less) respect. The table below lists each major race and some details about them. Though they hold no land, Tieflings, Aasimar, and Genasi are also listed below by virtue of being descendents of the major races. Hybrid races, such as half-Orcs and half-Elves (though more exist), are not listed. Note that "foes" are to be killed on sight; less intense feuds, such as that between Dwarves and Elves, are not considered.</p>

<p>There are more races, including Gith, Pixies, Sprites, Satyrs, Lizardfolk, Yuan-ti, Grung, Bugbears, and Shifters. These races are either too isolated, too few in number, or too timid to have any impact beyond their immediate territory (if any). Some of these races have yet to be discovered.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Much of Human and Halfling history has been forgotten due to the destruction caused by the <a href="primordials.html">Primordials</a>. Dwarves and Gnomes retained more thanks to their long lifespans and strong oral traditions. Elves, being unaging and also great storytellers, remember most of their history. Their records go back to nearly 18,000 years ago. It is believed all the other major races have similarly long, if forgotten, histories.</p>
<h2 id="major-races">Major Races</h2>
<h3 id="dragonborn">Dragonborn</h3>
<p>Dragonborn reside on the surface of <a href="world.html#dragon-island">Dragon Island</a>. They hunt in the jungles and the sea for wild boar, birds, and fish. The metallics and chromatics comprise the two factions, each hating the other but largely keeping to their side of the island. Each faction built a ziggurat on the sea-facing side of its respective caldera, worships dragons of its respective caste, and scours the seas to provide offerings to the dragons that visit.</p>
<h2 id="game-mechanics">Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>Below is a list of all races.</p>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="dragonborn">Dragonborn</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Dragonborn are often very strong and zealous, corresponding to high Strength and Charisma. More primal or reserved dragonborn may have sharper senses, corresponding to Wisdom.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dragonbornlings spend 6 months in an egg before hatching. Youths reach maturity at age 12 when they are 4 to 5 feet tall, but continue to grow their entire lives. Their wings typically develop around age 25. Old age begins at 70 years. Dragonborn rarely live past 80, since by that age, their still-growing size makes them increasingly vulnerable to heart failure.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> On Dragon Island, dragonborn of both creeds follow the examples set by their draconic forefathers. Metallic dragonborn on the island are intensely righteous and even callous, but never malicious. On the other hand, the chromatic dragonborn are egotistical, greedy, and ruled by strength.<br>Away from Dragon Island, these ideological trends are significantly less pronounced. Whatever an individual dragonborn's outlook, it is almost surely in the extreme; the only alignment that is rare in dragonborn is true neutrality.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Dragonborn are generally monolingual on Dragon Island, and most dragonborn who leave the island still retain their native tongue.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Adult dragonborn usually reach 6 feet tall within 20 years, after which their growth starts to slow. Even so, elder dragonborn often exceed 8 feet in height. Dragonborn also grow heavier throughout their life, with adults ranging from 200 to 400 pounds on average as they age.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Inheriting keen eyes from dragons, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Draconic Ancestry.</em></strong> Your draconic heritage manifests in several ways based on your draconic hue. Pick one dragon type from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits.</p> <h5 id="draconic-ancestry">Draconic Ancestry</h5> <table> <thead><tr><th>Dragon Type</th><th>Damage Type</th><th>Breath Weapon</th></tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td>Black</td><td>Acid</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Blue</td><td>Lightning</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Green</td><td>Poison</td><td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Red</td><td>Fire</td><td>15 ft. cone (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>White</td><td>Cold</td><td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Copper</td><td>Acid</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Gold</td><td>Fire</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)</td> <tr><td>Iron</td><td>Lightning</td><td>15 ft. cone (Dex. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Lead</td><td>Poison</td><td>15 ft. cone (Con. save)</td></tr> <tr><td>Silver</td><td>Cold</td><td>5 by 30 ft. line (Con. save)</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <p><strong><em>Breath Weapon.</em></strong> You can accumulate elemental energy within yourself and unleash it with your breath. You have a number of breath weapon dice equal to 2 + half your level, which are d6s. As a bonus action, you can roll and expend any number of these dice and force each creature in your breath weapon area to make a saving throw. The shape, saving throw, and damage type are determined by your Draconic Ancestry. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice). A creature takes damage equal the number rolled on the expended dice on a failed save, or half as much on a success.<br>You regain all expended breath weapon dice at the end of a short or long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damage Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Dwarves are exceptionally hardy by nature, and feats of strength, endurance, and courage are greatly admired in most Dwarvish cultures. As such, Dwarves have a significantly higher Strength and Constitution on average, and individual dwarves may possess high Wisdom or Charisma.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Due to their impressive fortitudes, dwarves rarely get sick at any age. It is common for Dwarves to live for over 150 years in perfect health. However, old age sets in at around 175 years, and few Dwarves live longer than 250 years.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Dwarvish cultures generally hold strongly to their laws and traditions, which are literally set in stone in most communities. Dwarves tend strongly towards lawful.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish. Due to the Dwarves' long lifespans and opposition to social change, the language hasn't changed much over time. Dwarvish serves as the common language of Gabroria, although there are noticeable differences in dialect between distant regions.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Despite averaging 4 feet tall, Dwarves are truly big-boned and often weigh over 200 pounds.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Descended from those accustomed to working in poorly lit tunnels, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Dwarven Fortitude.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance against poison damage. Furthermore, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Unencumberable.</em></strong> Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor, nor by wielding a <a href=/settings/four-corners/items.html#tower-shield>tower shield</a>. Furthermore, you have advantage on Athletics checks against being shoved.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Choose Cinder, Deep, Fjord, Hill, or Mountain Dwarf as your subrace.</p>
  <h4 id="fjord-dwarf">Fjord Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Ice Diver.</em></strong> Naturally more buoyant than other dwarves and adapted to freezing water, you have resistance against cold damage and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
<h4 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Ore Taster.</em></strong> As an action, you can taste a rock or alloy to identify its composition. You learn what minerals or metals are present, and in what quantity.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Crag Climber.</em></strong> Your tough nails and strong hands allow you to climb stone with ease. You have advantage on Athletics checks made to climb stone surfaces. You also have resistance against fall damage.</p>
<h4 id="hill-dwarf">Hill Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em></strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Unbreakable Bones.</em></strong> Bludgeoning damage you take is reduced by 1. This reduction is applied after any resistances and vulnerabilities.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dwarf">Deep Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Cave Senses.</em></strong> Your ancestors rarely left the safety of their cavern homes. Your darkvision has a range of 120 feet instead of 60 feet. You also have blindsight 10 feet and always know how the floor you stand on is sloped.</p>
<h4 id="cinder-dwarf">Cinder Dwarf</h4><p><strong><em>Volcano Dweller.</em></strong> As a descendant of dwarves who lived on the slopes of active volcanoes, you have resistance against fire damage and are immune to low doses of volcanic gas.</p>
</div>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="elf">Elf</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Like all Elves, Blessed Elves are naturally graceful and have keen senses. Due to their age, they are often knowledgeable as well. Blessed Elves have above-average Dexterity, as well as Intelligence and/or Wisdom.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Thanks to an ancient boon from their god, the Blessed Elves do not grow old. The only Blessed Elves who are visibly aged are the Elders, who were already old when they received the Blessing 12,000 years ago. All Elves reach physical maturity at about the same rate as humans, although a Blessed Elf is considered young until they are at least a century old. Blessed Elves are extremely cautious in battle so as not to die, and children are rare as the birthrate has steadily dropped since the Blessing. Most Blessed Elves are over 5,000 years old, although wars with hobgoblins took heavy tolls from some of the older generations.</p><p>The Mortal Elves have comparable lives to Humans, growing old at 70 and rarely living past 100 under normal circumstances.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Blessed Elves tend to be detached and view things in the long term. Since chaos and evil are unstable, almost all Blessed Elves are lawful or neutral good.</p><p>The Mortal Elves have a diverse range of alignments, more so than Humans. Sea Elves are overall neutral, with more spread in law/chaos than in good/evil. The danger of their undersea home makes many Sea Elves callous to others' misfortune, and jealousy of the Blessing drives some towards evil. Jungle Elves are outright evil as they seek to revive their god, a slain kraken, via blood sacrifices. On the other hand, Fey Elves are whimsical and lighthearted, invariably chaotic and generally good.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium. Elves are overall slenderer than Humans. Maladrin are slightly shorter than Humans, but the rest are about the same height on average.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Enhanced Darkvision.</em></strong> You have darkvision 60 feet. Furthermore, you can see in starlight as if it were bright light regardless of the actual light level, but distances beyond 60 feet are lightly obscured as if by mist. Instead of perceiving the usual color spectrum, most things under starlight take on shades of gray, but certain plants, animals, and minerals exhibit completely different colors that only Elves can see.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for half as long as normally required (still minimum 1 hour); see the rules on <a href='/settings/four-corners/rules.html#sleeping'>sleeping</a>. While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.</p>
  <h4 id="high-elf-nauvir">High Elf (Nauvir)</h4><p><strong><em>Blessed.</em></strong> You do not grow old, and are immune to the effects of magical aging.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and one Human language. Most Blessed Elves know Sonnern, the language used for most arcane study and the basis for the modern Elvish alphabet. You can also read and write the Old Script, in which each glyph is topologically unique.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Cantrip.</em></strong> You know one cantrip of you choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it. You can change the cantrip granted by this feature by spending 8 hours over the course of 2 days practicing. You can practice during short rests and long rests, but not while trancing.</p>
<h4 id="wood-elf-omavir">Wood Elf (Omavir)</h4><p><strong><em>Blessed.</em></strong> You do not grow old, and are immune to the effects of magical aging.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Elvish and one Human language. Most Blessed Elves know Sonnern, the language used for most arcane study and the basis for the modern Elvish alphabet. You can also read and write the Old Script, in which each glyph is topologically unique.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fleet of Foot.</em></strong> Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Mask of the Wild.</em></strong> You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Friend of Elks.</em></strong> You can speak Giant Elk. Giant elks share a home with Wood Elves in the hills of Verdania and respond to the call of a Wood Elf in need.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Home in the Trees.</em></strong> Your good balance and strong fingers are suited for climbing high in trees. You have advantage on Athletics made to climb trees or other plants. You are also able to rest comfortably in trees without risk of falling.</p>
<h4 id="sea-elf-maredrin">Sea Elf (Maredrin)</h4><p><strong><em>The King's Wish.</em></strong> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Marese and either Merrish or Tritonian. Marese is the native language of Maredrin, and many Maredrin have dealings with Merfolk or Tritons.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Underwater Camouflage.</em></strong> You have advantage on Stealth checks underwater.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Underwater Grace.</em></strong> When you take the Dodge action underwater, you also gain the benefits of the Dash and Disengage actions.</p>
<h4 id="jungle-elf-maledrin">Jungle Elf (Maledrin)</h4><p><strong><em>The King's Wish.</em></strong> You have a swimming speed of 30 feet, and you can breathe air and water.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Malese. Malese is the native language of the Maledrin and is closely related to Marese.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Jungle Walker.</em></strong> Your body is built for climbing quickly and surely. You a climbing speed of 20 feet and advantage on Acrobatics checks to avoid falling due to narrow walkspace. You also ignore difficult terrain due to dense plant growth.</p>
<h4 id="fey-elf-eladrin">Fey Elf (Eladrin)</h4><p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Sylvan and High Sylvan. High Sylvan branched off from Elvish long before the Blessing and is spoken only by the aristocracy of the Feywild, including most Eladrin. Sylvan is the vulgar form of High Sylvan and is spoken by common denizens of the Feywild.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Glamour.</em></strong> As an action, you can create an illusion to make yourself look different. The illusion lasts until you use an action to end it or to make a new illusion. The illusion does not affect your clothing or equipment and you cannot change your height or body shape, but otherwise the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p><p>The illusion fails to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this feature to add horns to your head, objects pass through the horns, and anyone who touches them would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.</p><p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Flare Glamour.</em></strong> Starting at 3rd level, you can flare your glamour for a more potent effect. When you use Glamour, you can augment your guise with any of the following otherworldly elements: an aura of light or darkness, up to a foot of increased height, altered clothing and equipment, indistinct sounds, or the amplification of your voice. You may also choose to be evoke fear or awe. If you do so, each creature within 10 feet of you that can see and hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Glamour DC or be frightened (fear) or charmed (awe) until they can no longer see nor hear your Glamour, or until they take damage. You also have advantage on Charisma checks for the duration of the Glamour.</p><p>When you use your Glamour in this way, it ends after 1 minute, and you cannot use Glamour again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Your creature type is Humanoid and Fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Soul.</em></strong> Your soul is tied to the Feywild. You age half as quickly in the Feywild, but you cannot cast spells or use magic outside of it.</p><p>Some Eladrin have found ways of severing their tie and restoring their ability to use magic. One way (but not the only way) you can accomplish this is with the <a href='../feats.html#recovered-soul'>Recovered Soul</a> feat.</p>
</div>

<div class="race-card">
  <h3 id="gnome">Gnome</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Abilities.</em></strong> Gnome physiology varies more than that of a typical race, but the majority of gnomes have deft hands and quick wits. Dexterity and Intelligence are most commonly high in gnomes, although rock gnomes exhibit impressive Strength and Constitution just as often.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Gnomes mature quickly and reach adulthood by 18. They live about as long as humans but reach old age sooner, at age 60.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most gnomes are free-spirited and ambitious in their own way. This usually manifests as a chaotic tilt, but plenty of gnomes ardently hold to law or personal codes. There is so much variation that any alignment is likely.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Small. Gnomes average about 3 feet high.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Gnome Cunning.</em></strong> You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Creative Spark.</em></strong> Before you make an ability check, you can add 1d4 and subtract 2 from the result. The size of the die and the penalty increase as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Creative Spark Size table. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), regaining expended uses after a long rest.</p><h5 id="creative-spark-size">Creative Spark Size</h5> <table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Die</th><th>Penalty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-4</td><td>1d4</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>5-8</td><td>1d6</td><td>-3</td></tr><tr><td>9-12</td><td>1d8</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>13-16</td><td>1d10</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>17-20</td><td>1d12</td><td>-6</td></tr></tbody></table>
  <h4 id="rock-tinker-gnome">Rock (Tinker) Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write one dialect of Gabrorian Gnomish. Gabrorian Gnomish has many dialects–more than one per city–and some are only barely mutually intelligible.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Small but Sturdy.</em></strong> You ignore the heavy property of weapons.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Alert to Magic.</em></strong> You know the <i>identify</i> spell and can cast it as an action without material components a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="rot-gnome">Rot Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write the Tiris Vale dialect of Gabrorian Gnomish. This dialect is extreme and incorporates lisps into some words, as Rot Gnomes often have speech impediments.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Partially Undead.</em></strong> You register as undead to abilities that detect undead, and healing that can't normally affect an undead creature restores half as many hit points to you.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Your undead nature grants you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Undead Resilience.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease, and you have resistance against poison and necrotic damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Dead Flesh.</em></strong> Some of your body is decayed and unfeeling. Whenever you take damage of a type other than radiant or psychic, reduce that damage by 1 after applying any resistances and vulnerabilities. However, your hit point maximum decreases by 1, and it decreases by 1 every time you gain a level. This cannot reduce your hit point maximum below 1.</p>
<h4 id="sand-gnome">Sand Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Sand Gnomish. Sand Gnomish is a close cousin to standard Gabrorian Gnomish but lacks Dwarvish influence.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Eye for Illusions.</em></strong> You have advantage on Perception and Investigation checks to identify magical illusions as such, as the illusion magic leaves a distinctive impression on your mind. You can use this to faintly sense creatures that are magically invisible. Rather than automatically failing on ability checks that require seeing a magically invisible creature, you just have disadvantage and cannot gain advantage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Calloused Mind.</em></strong> You have resistance against psychic damage.</p>
<h4 id="fey-gnome">Fey Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Fey Gnomish and Sylvan. Sylvan is the common language of the Feywild and shares some vocabulary Fey Gnomish.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> Your creature type is Humanoid and Fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Slip Away.</em></strong> When a creature you can see is about to attack you, you can use a reaction to magically turn invisible until the end of your next turn, potentially causing the attack roll to have disadvantage. The invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature once, regaining the ability to do so after a short or long rest.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Born Prankster.</em></strong> You know the <i>prestidigitation</i> cantrip. Fey Gnomes are known to use this spell to great effect in practical jokes.</p>
<h4 id="forest-gnome">Forest Gnome</h4><p><strong><em>Language.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write either Verdanian Gnomish or a unique dialect of Fey Gnomish depending on whether you grew up in Verdania or Gabroria, respectively. Like Fey Gnomish, Verdanian Gnomish has many words in common with Sylvan.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Speak with Small Beasts.</em></strong> Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with Small or smaller beasts.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Natural Illusionist.</em></strong> You know the <i>minor illusion</i> cantrip and can cast it without material components. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
