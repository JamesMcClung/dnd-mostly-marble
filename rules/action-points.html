        <h1 id="action-points">Action Points</h1>
<div class="p">Instead of having an action and a possible bonus action on each of your turns, you have 3 action points. In this system, an "action" costs a number of action points, or AP. Unless stated otherwise, you can't use the same action more than once per turn and you can't use actions outside of your turn (including free actions).</div>
<div class="p"><b><i>Free Action (0 AP).</i></b> Free actions take negligible time or effort to peform. Interacting with an object is an example of a free action.</div>
<div class="p"><b><i>Minor Action (1 AP).</i></b> Minor actions are quick to perform and often involve setting up or sustaining an effect. Almost all of what were prevously called "bonus actions" are minor actions.</div>
<div class="p"><b><i>Standard Action (2 AP).</i></b> Standard actions make up the bulk of a turn. Almost all of what were prevously called "actions" are standard actions. The Dash and Attack actions are examples of repeatable standard actions.</div>
<div class="p"><b><i>Major Action (3 AP).</i></b> Major actions are particularly intensive, using up the entirety of a typical turn. They are rare. Certain powerful spells, such as <i>fireball</i>, could be major actions.</div>
<div class="p"><b><i>No Action.</i></b> Some trivial or automatic effects do not count as actions at all, and can be performed at any time. Willingly ending concentration or letting go of something fall into this category.</div>
<h2 id="readying-an-action">Readying an Action</h2>
<div class="p">The Ready action costs a number of AP equal to the action you are readying. Like most actions, you can't use the Ready action twice on the same turn.</div>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<div class="p">The rules for reactions are as normal.</div>
<h2 id="ap-as-a-resource">AP as a Resource</h2>
<div class="p">Effects may change the number of AP you get on your turns. For example, the <i>haste</i> spell could grant an additional AP, <i>slow</i> could reduce AP, and a fighter's Action Surge could give 2 additional AP on the turn it is used.</div>
