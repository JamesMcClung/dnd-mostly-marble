For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</div> <h4 id="half-cover" class="noHeaderID">Half Cover</h4> <div class="p">A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</div> <h4 id="three-quarters-cover" class="noHeaderID">Three-Quarters Cover</h4> <div class="p">A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</div> <h4 id="total-cover" class="noHeaderID">Total Cover</h4> <div class="p">A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect.
