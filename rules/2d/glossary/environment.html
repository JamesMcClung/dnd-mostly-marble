While falling, you drop another 180 feet at the start of each of your turns.</div> <div class="p">On impact, you take one <a href="/rules/2d.html#size-die">size die</a> of bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of 20 dice. You land <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="conditions#prone" onclick='handleAnchorClick("conditions#prone", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("conditions#prone", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("conditions#prone", event)'>prone</span> unless you avoid taking damage from the fall, such as via the <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="reactions#break_fall" onclick='handleAnchorClick("reactions#break_fall", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("reactions#break_fall", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("reactions#break_fall", event)'>Break Fall</span> reaction.</div> <div class="p">If you land in a creature's space, that creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. It can choose to fail. On a failed save, the fall damage is split evenly between you and it.</div> </div> <div class="small-card"> <h1 id="light">Light</h1> <div class="p">There are three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.</div> <div class="p">A source of light typically emits bright light in a small radius and dim light in a larger radius; these distances are given in parentheses. For example, a fire that sheds light (20/40 ft.) produces bright light within 20 feet and dim light for another 20 feet beyond that.</div> <h4 id="bright-light">Bright Light</h4> <div class="p">Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.</div> <h4 id="dim-light">Dim Light</h4> <div class="p">Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="environment#obscured" onclick='handleAnchorClick("environment#obscured", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("environment#obscured", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("environment#obscured", event)'>obscured</span> area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.</div> <h4 id="darkness">Darkness</h4> <div class="p">Darkness creates a heavily <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="environment#obscured" onclick='handleAnchorClick("environment#obscured", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("environment#obscured", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("environment#obscured", event)'>obscured</span> area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.</div> </div> <div class="small-card"> <h1 id="cover">Cover</h1> <div class="p">Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</div> <div class="p">There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</div> <h4 id="half-cover">Half Cover</h4> <div class="p">A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</div> <h4 id="three-quarters-cover">Three-Quarters Cover</h4> <div class="p">A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</div> <h4 id="total-cover">Total Cover</h4> <div class="p">A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</div> </div> <div class="small-card"> <h1 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h1> <div class="p">Each foot traveled through an area of difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot of <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/movement.html">movement</a> unless otherwise stated. For example, the difficult terrain created by the <a href="/rules/2d/player-options/spells.html#plant-growth"><i>plant growth</i></a> costs 3 extra feet of movement per foot traveled. A creature traveling through an area of overlapping sources of difficult terrain only pays the movement cost of the most expensive terrain.</div> <div class="p">Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</div> </div> <div class="small-card"> <h1 id="obscured">Obscured</h1> <div class="p">When vision in an area is hindered by smoke, darkness, or a similar phenomenon, the area is obscured. There are two degrees of obscurity.</div> <h4 id="lightly-obscured">Lightly Obscured</h4> <div class="p">In a lightly obscured area, such as <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/environment.html#dim-light">dim light</a>, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/skills.html#perception">Perception</a> checks that rely on <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/senses.html#base-senses">sight</a>.</div> <h4 id="heavily-obscured">Heavily Obscured</h4> <div class="p">A heavily obscured area, such as <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/environment.html#darkness">darkness</a>, opaque fog, or dense foliage, blocks vision entirely. Nothing in that area can be seen.</div> </div> <div class="small-card"> <h1 id="space">Space</h1> <div class="p">Your size determines how much space you occupy. In combat, you normally occupy a square with a side length given by the Normal column of the Creature Sizes table below. This area, often refered to as "your space," represents the space you need to move and fight unhindered. You control your space, and can prevent other creatures within 1 size category of yourself from sharing it. Additionally, your space counts as both <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="environment#difficult_terrain" onclick='handleAnchorClick("environment#difficult_terrain", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("environment#difficult_terrain", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("environment#difficult_terrain", event)'>difficult terrain</span> and half <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="environment#cover" onclick='handleAnchorClick("environment#cover", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("environment#cover", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("environment#cover", event)'>cover</span> for all creatures other than yourself.</div> <div class="p">You do not have to occupy your normal amount of space. If you occupy less, whether by choice or by force, you suffer penalties.</div> <h4 id="squeezing">Squeezing</h4> <div class="p">Squeezing can reduce one or both side lengths of your space down to the value in the Squeezing column of the Creature Sizes table. You are <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="conditions#hindered" onclick='handleAnchorClick("conditions#hindered", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("conditions#hindered", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("conditions#hindered", event)'>hindered</span> while squeezing.</div> <h4 id="stuck">Stuck</h4> <div class="p">The value in the Stuck column of the Creature Sizes table is the minimum side length your area of control can have. If at least one side length of your area of control is between the "Stuck" and "Squeezing" values, you are stuck. While stuck, you are <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="conditions#restrained" onclick='handleAnchorClick("conditions#restrained", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("conditions#restrained", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("conditions#restrained", event)'>restrained</span>. You can use a standard action to make a DC 10 <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/skills.html#athletics">Athletics</a> or <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/skills.html#acrobatics">Acrobatics</a> check. On a success, you are <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="conditions#hindered" onclick='handleAnchorClick("conditions#hindered", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("conditions#hindered", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("conditions#hindered", event)'>hindered</span> instead of restrained until the end of the current turn.</div> <h4 id="crushed">Crushed</h4> <div class="p">You can't willingly reduce a side length of your space to less than the value in the Stuck column of the Creature Sizes table. If you are forced to, you immediately take 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each inch your space's shorter side length subceeds your Stuck value, and you are crushed. You take this damage again at the end of each of your turns as long as you remain crushed. You are also stuck while crushed, and the DC to try to move increases by 1 for each inch your space's shorter side length subceeds your Stuck value.</div> <div class="tableAndCaption"> <span class="caption" id="creature-sizes">Creature Sizes</span> <div class="tableWrapper"> <table> <thead> <tr><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Size</span></th><th align="center"><span class="col-title">Normal</span></th><th align="center"><span class="col-title">Squeezing</span></th><th align="center"><span class="col-title">Stuck</span></th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td align="left">Minuscule</td><td align="center">≤1 ft.</td><td align="center">≤6 in.</td><td align="center">≤1 in.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Tiny</td><td align="center">2 ft.</td><td align="center">1 ft.</td><td align="center">6 in.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Small</td><td align="center">3 ft.</td><td align="center">2 ft.</td><td align="center">1 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Medium</td><td align="center">5 ft.</td><td align="center">3 ft.</td><td align="center">2 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Large</td><td align="center">10 ft.</td><td align="center">5 ft.</td><td align="center">3 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Huge</td><td align="center">15 ft.</td><td align="center">10 ft.</td><td align="center">5 ft.</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Gargantuan</td><td align="center">≥20 ft.</td><td align="center">≥15 ft.</td><td align="center">≥10 ft.</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> </div> <div class="small-card"> <h1 id="underwater">Underwater</h1> <div class="p">The following rules apply underwater:</div> <ul> <li>Melee weapon attack rolls have disadvantage.</li> <li>Ranged weapon attack rolls have disadvantage, and a ranged weapon attack against a target beyond the weapon's normal range automatically misses.</li> <li>Fire damage and acid damage are halved.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <script src="/js/sortTable.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/search.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/popup-data.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/popup.js" defer="defer"></script> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
