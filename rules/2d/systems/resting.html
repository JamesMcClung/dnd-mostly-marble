You can end a rest at any time, however.</div> <h2 id="short-rest">Short Rest</h2> <div class="p">A <b>short rest</b> takes 1 hour. It consists of light activity, such as treating wounds, meditating, or standing guard. You can't take a short rest while <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/conditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a> unless another creature tends to you. If you take any damage during a short rest, you must restart. At the end of a short rest, you regain each resource that recharges on a short rest and that was expended before the rest began. It is also acceptable to gain the full benefits of the <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="actions#heal" onclick='handleAnchorClick("actions#heal", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("actions#heal", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("actions#heal", event)'>Heal</span> action as many times as you like, as long as someone is capable of healing you and succeeding on the check.</div> <h2 id="long-rest">Long Rest</h2> <div class="p">A <b>long rest</b> takes 8 hours.
