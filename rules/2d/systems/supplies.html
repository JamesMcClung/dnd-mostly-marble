In order to get the benefits of a short rest, long rest, or sleep, you need access to food, water, and shelter at a minimum. Supplies are an abstraction of these and other sundries necessary for safe travel.</div> <h2 id="traveling-on-roads">Traveling on Roads</h2> <div class="p">Most roads pass by towns or farms frequently enough that a bed is never far. You can gain the benefits of a short rest, long rest, or sleep if you do so in a building with access to food and water, such as an inn, farmhouse, or hayloft.</div> <div class="p">There are many methods of paying for room and board. The three most common methods are detailed below.</div> <h3 id="paying-with-coin">Paying with Coin</h3> <div class="p">A standard meal and a bed goes for 1 sp at most town inns. An inn with noble guests might offer luxury rooms starting at 1 gp.</div> <h3 id="paying-with-work">Paying with Work</h3> <div class="p">Most farmers and some town inns will accept physical labor instead of coin to pay for room and board. A cumulative DC 20 Strength check, where each attempt takes 1 hour, is ususally enough to pay for the needs of one person.</div> <div class="p">Proficiency in a relevant tool, such as an axe to chop wood, allow the user to add their proficiency in that tool to the check.</div> <h3 id="paying-with-entertainment">Paying with Entertainment</h3> <div class="p">Some farmers and many inns are willing to provide accommodations in exchange for a performance. A cumulative Performance check, where each attempt takes 1 hour, is usually enough to pay for the needs of the party. The check DC is equal to 20 times the number of party members.</div> <div class="p">Only one member can attempt the check each hour, but every participating member using a musical instrument can add their instrument proficiency to the check.</div> <h2 id="traveling-in-wilderness">Traveling in Wilderness</h2> <div class="p">In order to safely rest in the wilderness, one member of your party must make a Survival check over the course of 1 hour to find the necessary supplies. The result of that check determines what kind of rest you and your party can safely take, as shown in the Supply Check Base DC table. A rest of a higher tier includes each rest of the lower tiers.</div> <div class="tableAndCaption"> <span class="caption" id="supply-check-base-dc">Supply Check Base DC</span> <div class="tableWrapper"> <table> <thead> <tr><th align="center"><span class="col-title">Tier</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Rest</span></th><th align="center"><span class="col-title">DC</span></th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="left">Short rest</td><td align="center">5</td></tr> <tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="left">Sleep</td><td align="center">10</td></tr> <tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="left">Long rest</td><td align="center">15</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div class="p">If any of the below situations applies to one or more party members, add its modifier to the Supply Check DC.</div> <div class="tableAndCaption"> <span class="caption" id="supply-check-modifiers">Supply Check Modifiers</span> <div class="tableWrapper"> <table> <thead> <tr><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Situation</span></th><th align="center"><span class="col-title">DC Modifier</span></th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td align="left">Lush environment (tropics)</td><td align="center">-5</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Bad weather and no tent</td><td align="center">Up to +5</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Cold temperatures without insulation</td><td align="center">Up to +5</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Barren environment (desert, arctic)</td><td align="center">+5</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <h3 id="searching-with-impaired-vision">Searching with Impaired Vision</h3> <div class="p">If you make the Supply Check in a region that is lightly obscured, you have disadvantage on the check. In a heavily obscured region, you have disdvantage and can't gain advantage on the check.</div> <h3 id="hunting-tools">Hunting Tools</h3> <div class="p">Relevant hunting tools, such as a fishing rod or ranged weapon, give advantage on the Supply Check if the user is proficient in their use.</div> <h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3> <div class="p">If a member of the party has proficiency with cook's utensils, that member can spend 1 hour cooking immediately after a Supply Check. Doing so increases the result of the Supply Check by the cook's proficiency with cook's utensils, potentially opening up a new rest option.</div> <h3 id="resting-without-supplies">Resting Without Supplies</h3> <div class="p">You can attempt to rest even if you failed to find sufficient supplies. In this case, make a Constitution check over the course of the attempted rest. The DC is equal to the Supply Check DC for the attempted rest, including any modifiers. On a success, you gain the benefits of the rest.</div> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy. Not approved/endorsed by Wizards.
