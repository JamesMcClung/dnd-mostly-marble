Nothing can ever have more hit points than its <b>hit point maximum</b>; similarly, nothing can ever have fewer than 0 hit points. If an effect would change a target's hit points past either of these bounds, it changes the target's hit points to the limiting bound instead.</div> <div class="p">As a player, your hit point maximum is determined by your <a href="/rules/2d/player-options/classes.html">class</a>. Other effects may temporarily or permanently modify a creature's hit point maximum, including yours.</div> <div class="p">A creature is <b>bloodied</b> if it has less than or equal to half its maximum number of hit point. This is the point at which the creature's body shows obvious signs of harm. In general, it is possible to tell at a glance whether a creature is bloodied.</div> <h2 id="damage">Damage</h2> <div class="p">Whenever a creature or object takes <b>damage</b>, it loses a number of hit points equal to the damage taken. As stated above, if damage would reduce a target's number of hit points to below 0, its number of hit points is reduced to 0 instead.</div> <h2 id="dropping-to-0-hit-points">Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h2> <div class="p">When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls <a href="/rules/2d/glossary/conditions.html#unconscious">unconscious</a>, gains 1 level of <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="conditions#exhaustion" onclick='handleAnchorClick("conditions#exhaustion", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("conditions#exhaustion", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("conditions#exhaustion", event)'>exhaustion</span>, and begins <span class="popupAnchor" data-injection-arg="conditions#dying" onclick='handleAnchorClick("conditions#dying", this, event)' onmouseover='showPopup("conditions#dying", this, event)' onmouseout='hidePopup("conditions#dying", event)'>dying</span>. Objects aren't so lucky; they are simply destroyed upon dropping to 0 hit points.</div> <blockquote> <h4 id="variant-rule-instant-npc-death">Variant Rule: Instant NPC Death</h4> <div class="p">It can be burdensome for the DM to track the death saving throws of every dying creature. The DM may elect for most creatures to die instantly upon being reduced to 0 hit points. As a middle ground, the DM might only track death saving throws for creatures reduced exactly to zero hit points, without any excess damage.</div> </blockquote> <h2 id="temporary-hit-points">Temporary Hit Points</h2> <div class="p"><b>Temporary hit points</b> are special hit points that are tracked separately from your normal hit points. When you take damage, reduce your temporary hit points first (to a minimum of 0), and only reduce your normal hit points by excess damage.</div> <div class="p">Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you gain temporary hit points while you already have some, you must either lose your existing temporary hit points or forego the new temporary hit points.</div> <div class="p">Unless otherwise specified, temporary hit points disappear when you finish a long rest.</div> <script src="/js/sortTable.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/search.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/popup-data.js" defer="defer"></script> <script src="/js/popup.js" defer="defer"></script> </article> <footer> This website is unofficial Fan Content permitted under the Fan Content Policy.
