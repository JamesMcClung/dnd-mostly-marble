When you can move and no speed is specified, you choose which speed(s) to use. When using multiple speeds in the same move, keep track of how much movement you spend; you can't keep moving with a speed once you've spent more movement than the speed allows. For example, if you have a walk speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 60 feet, you can fly 20 feet and then walk 10 feet. At this point, you can't walk anymore, but you can still fly up to 30 more feet.</div> <h2 id="related-actions">Related Actions</h2> <div class="p">The <b>Move action</b> is a non-repeatable, non-atomic free action that lets you move up to your speed. The <b>Dash action</b> is a repeatable, non-atomic standard action that <span class="tooltipWrapper"><span class="tooltipAnchor">also lets you move up to your speed</span><span class="tooltip">These actions are kept separate because some abilities interact with the Dash action, but not the Move action.</span></span>.</div> <h2 id="forced-movement">Forced Movement</h2> <div class="p">Movement caused by a push, pull, or other external force is called <b>forced movement</b>. An effect that <i>moves you</i> specifies how far you are moved, ignoring difficult terrain and similar hindrances. Note that an effect with the phrase "when you move" isn't triggered by forced movement. For example, if grappling lets you drag a creature along with you <i>when you move</i>, you don't drag the creature if you are pushed.</div> <h2 id="movement-modes">Movement Modes</h2> <div class="p">A movement mode lets you move in a particular way. You can use a movement mode <b>actively</b> or <b>passively</b> if you have a speed that gives access to it. For example, if you have a walk speed, you can use the <b>walking</b> movement mode actively to walk across the ground, and you use it passively to avoid falling prone.You can benefit from the passive use of a movement mode as long as you have a speed giving access to that mode, even if that speed is 0.</div> <div class="tableAndCaption"> <span class="caption" id="movement-modes">Movement Modes</span> <div class="tableWrapper"> <table> <thead> <tr><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Mode</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Active Use</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Passive Use</span></th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td align="left">Burrowing</td><td align="left">Dig through loose substrate</td><td align="left">Keep loose substrate from hindering you (and not get stuck)</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Climbing</td><td align="left">Ascend or descend a vertical surface</td><td align="left">Hold on (and not fall)</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Crawling</td><td align="left">Move while prone</td><td align="left">—</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Flying</td><td align="left">Fly through the air</td><td align="left">Remain airborne (and not fall)</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Swimming</td><td align="left">Swim through water</td><td align="left">Tread water (and not sink)</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Teleporting</td><td align="left">Instantly travel without going through intervening space</td><td align="left">—</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Walking</td><td align="left">Walk, jog, or run across a solid surface</td><td align="left">Stand (and not fall prone)</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <h3 id="movement-modifiers">Movement Modifiers</h3> <div class="p">A <b>movement modifier</b> is a special movement mode that affects how you move.</div> <div class="tableAndCaption"> <span class="caption" id="movement-modifiers">Movement Modifiers</span> <div class="tableWrapper"> <table> <thead> <tr><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Modifier</span></th><th align="left"><span class="col-title">Use</span></th></tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr><td align="left">Jumping</td><td align="left">Launch yourself into the air</td></tr> <tr><td align="left">Shifting</td><td align="left">Move within a creature's reach without provoking opportunity attacks</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <h2 id="speeds">Speeds</h2> <div class="p">A speed has an associated distance and grants access to one or more movement modes.
