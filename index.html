            <div class="p">A standard fantasy world. The city-states of the northern Laurelei had just begun to explore Minwe, the land south of a vast desert. That's when a war broke out between dragons, and many gods rose to power and fell from it in the chaos. The world is now on a path to recovery.</div>

            <div class="p">A shielded city within a jungle full of hostile spirits is the last sanctuary for the humanoid races. The wild was not always so dangerous; centuries ago, people were free to travel all over the land, but the spirit-led apocalypse decimated the old cities and it is unclear whether any other pockets of civilization survived.</div>

            <div class="p">A world where the Primordials have (mostly) been tamed, intercontinental trade is in full swing, and otherworldly beings exert their influence.</div>
