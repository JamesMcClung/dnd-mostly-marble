        <h1>James' DnD Wiki</h1>
        <p>Where I put all my notes (since June 2021).</p>

        <h2>Rules & Systems</h2>
        <p>Setting-agnostic rules.</p>

        <h3><a href="rules/feat-points.html" class="home-ref">&rarr;</a> Feat Points</h3>
        <p>A replacement for the usual method of acquiring feats.</p>

        &lt;redacted>

        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>These are all the worlds I've created, in varying detail. Not all of my notes have been moved here.</p>

        <h3>Laurelei/Minwe</h3>
        <p>A standard fantasy world. The city-states of the northern Laurelei had just begun to explore Minwe, the land south of a vast desert. That's when a war broke out between dragons, and many gods rose to power and fell from it in the chaos. The world is now on a path to recovery.</p>

        <h3>Eris</h3>
        <p>A shielded city within a jungle full of hostile spirits is the last sanctuary for the humanoid races. The wild was not always so dangerous; centuries ago, people were free to travel all over the land, but the spirit-led apocalypse decimated the old cities and it is unclear whether any other pockets of civilization survived.</p>

        <h3><a href="settings/four-corners.html" class="home-ref">&rarr;</a> Four Corners</h3>
        <p>A Tolkienesque world where the Primordials have (mostly) been tamed, intercontinental trade is in full swing, and otherworldly beings exert their influence.</p>
